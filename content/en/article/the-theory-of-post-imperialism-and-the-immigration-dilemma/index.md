## The Theory of Post-Imperialism and the Immigration Dilemma

Historically, monarchs and imperial powers plundered wealth and resources from colonies in Africa, Asia, and South America. By "monarchs," we refer not only to emperors but also to those individuals who amassed substantial fortunes through the exploitation of these colonies.

The nexus between wealth and politics is profound. Those with financial resources have the capability to influence governments, academic institutions, and various organizations by deploying lobbyists. In the context of Western democracies, where the electoral process is established and comparatively transparent, the affluent strive to secure electoral victories to advance their interests.

Transitioning to the post-imperial era, which is commonly marked by the dissolution of major imperial powers post-World War II, the beneficiaries of imperial wealth continue to wield significant influence. They possess the means to sway elections and shape political landscapes. Consider a scenario where a faction, lacking the monetary clout of imperial descendants, aspires for power. Their strategy? To encourage the influx of immigrants from former colonies. This approach posits that immigrants could serve as a pivotal electoral base, enabling this group to attain power without the financial backing comparable to that of the erstwhile imperial elite.

## Islamobolsheviks

This narrative introduces a term, "Islamobolsheviks," to describe those who challenge the established power structures previously dominated by imperial beneficiaries. The label is crafted from combining "Islamic," reflecting the predominant origin of immigrants in Europe and the USA, and "Bolsheviks," indicating a strategy to overturn the current power dynamics through the mobilization of mass immigration. This terminology seeks to encapsulate the tactical approach of utilizing immigrants from predominantly Islamic countries as a means to challenge and potentially alter the prevailing political landscape.

The assertion that political power can be gained through immigration is examined by looking at specific instances, particularly within the context of European and American immigration crises. By analyzing these situations, we can observe the dynamics of immigration and its potential impact on political power structures.

### French is Algeria

Taking France as a case study, we delve into the historical backdrop of the Algerian War. During this period, President Charles de Gaulle advocated for Algeria's independence from France, successfully countering the "Organisation armée secrète" [(OAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_arm%C3%A9e_secr%C3%A8te), a militant group adamant that "Algeria is French and will remain so." Following Algeria's independence, de Gaulle's policies marked a significant shift in France's international posture, including withdrawal from NATO and the establishment of closer ties with the USSR, reflecting a divergence from traditional Western alliances.

This historical context sets the stage for a contemporary examination of immigration in France. Today, immigrants, particularly from former colonies like Algeria, represent a significant portion of the French population. This demographic shift prompts some to invert the OAS's slogan, suggesting that, metaphorically, "France is becoming Algeria," a statement reflecting the profound cultural and demographic changes stemming from immigration. This observation ties back to the proposed theory that immigration can substantially influence the political and social fabric of a nation.

### Mexico is USA

The situation at the US-Mexico border serves as another illustration of how immigration policies can reflect deeper political strategies and conflicts. The Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, took measures to reinforce the border with Mexico through the [construction of barriers](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-signs-historic-border-security-measures-in-brownsville), aiming to curb illegal immigration. This action underscores a broader national debate on immigration policy and border security.

Contrastingly, the federal government, under Democratic President Joe Biden, who is perceived to be influenced by the progressive wing of his party, has approached the issue [differently](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/14/politics/immigration-texas-border-dhs-letter-ken-paxton/index.html). The assertion here is that some members of this progressive faction, characterized by their support for more inclusive immigration policies, have influenced national policy directions. This divergence in approach led to legal challenges, with the judiciary playing a pivotal role in the debate over border security measures.

Videos circulating that show migrants crossing the border with what appears to be minimal intervention from border authorities have sparked controversy and debate. Critics of the Biden administration argue that its policies effectively encourage illegal immigration, with the underlying suggestion that new immigrants might predominantly support the Democratic Party in future elections.

This complex interplay of state versus federal authority, alongside the politicization of immigration policy, reflects the multifaceted nature of the immigration debate in the United States. It showcases how immigration is not just a matter of border security or international relations but also a significant domestic political issue that influences and is influenced by broader political strategies and ideological divisions.

## Conclusion

The theory of leveraging immigration as a strategic means to shift political power dynamics, illustrated through examples from both France and the United States, underscores the profound impact immigration policies can have on national identity, social cohesion, and political landscapes. In France, the historical context of the Algerian War and its aftermath highlight the long-term cultural and demographic shifts stemming from decolonization. In the United States, contemporary debates over border security and immigration reform reflect deep ideological divides and the politicization of immigration policy.

This theory suggests that immigration, whether perceived as a challenge or an opportunity, is not merely a matter of administrative or security concern but a pivotal factor in the contest for political power. It illustrates how demographic changes, driven by immigration, can influence electoral outcomes, public policy, and national discourse. The examples of France and the United States demonstrate that the implications of immigration extend beyond immediate economic or social impacts to encompass broader questions of identity, sovereignty, and power.

Ultimately, the theory invites a more nuanced consideration of how nations navigate the complexities of immigration in a globalized world. It challenges policymakers, scholars, and the public to consider the long-term implications of immigration policies and the role they play in shaping the future of nations.
