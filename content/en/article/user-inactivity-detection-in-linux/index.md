We want to detect user inactivity on Linux system in a bash service run by systemd. Why? When user is inactive, we can launch some CPU-heavy tasks without disrupting user's interaction with the system.

A user has 2 primary ways of interaction with Linux system: through textual terminal or UI desktop like Cinnamon, Xface, etc. The methods of user (in)activity detection are different for terminal and UI. 

## UI environment

We conduct our tests on Linux Mint 20.3 (Una) with MATE 1.26.0, Linux Kernel 5.15.0-121.

`xprintidle` seems a perfect solution for detection of user inactivity in Mate UI. The utility is not installed
by default, however.

Here is a one-liner to test the utility. Run it in a terminal session under Mate:

```bash
while true; do echo "$(date)|$(xprintidle)"; sleep 10; done
```

A sample output:

```

We checked the following UI managers where `xprintidle` works as expected.

|OS|UI|xprintidle|Available in repo|
|--|--|----------|-----------------|
|Linux Mint 20.3 (una)|Mate 1.26.0|ðŸ˜€|ðŸ˜€|
|Linux Mint 21.3 (virginia)|Xface 4|ðŸ˜€|ðŸ˜€|
|Fedora Linux 40|Cinnamon|ðŸ˜€|ðŸ˜• (manual compilation|

### How to manually compile xprintidle on Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc make libX11-devel libXtst-devel
git clone https://github.com/lucianposton/xprintidle
cd xprintidle
./configure
make
make install
```
