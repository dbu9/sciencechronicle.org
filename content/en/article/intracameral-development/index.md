## Introduction

_"Do not swear off either prison or poverty."_

There are many methods that law enforcement agencies use to uncover crimes and understand how and by whom they were committed. However, we will focus solely on psychological techniques that can be used to extract information during a suspect’s time in a cell.

One such technique, or rather a series of techniques, known as "operational combination," is intracameral development. The idea behind these methods is that when a person is placed in a prison cell, they are usually in an emotionally depressed state, anxious about their future, actions, and how they ended up in this situation. Law enforcement takes advantage of these circumstances to extract necessary information before the person regains their psychological stability.

It's also worth noting that, often, when a person is removed from their familiar environment and faces a threat, they seek support (unless they are a psychopath). This need for support is used to create rapport. Moreover, a social psychological mechanism exists where people who find themselves in the same unpleasant situation tend to bond. This is because humans are social animals and have historically survived more easily with the support of others, much like the famous "soldier's camaraderie." This mechanism increases trust and a willingness to share information in search of support and advice from someone in a similar situation.

## What is the purpose of this technique?

In general, this technique involves placing an undercover police officer or a previously recruited prisoner, referred to as the "source," into the cell with the target individual (referred to as the "subject"). The source's task is to use various tricks to get the subject to talk about their actions—details they wouldn’t disclose directly to a police officer.

## Techniques Used by the Source to Obtain Information

1. **Instilling Hopelessness**  
   The source constantly emphasizes that there is no way out, that no one can help, and that punishment will be severe. They may describe in vivid detail how people were broken or tortured, how those who hoped for freedom ended up failing. The only way to "save their soul" is to confess everything.

2. **Intimidation**  
   An old but effective method. Fear arises when a person is faced with a threat they can't handle. This method may involve describing how the person could be tortured or how they will suffer in prison, detailing the losses they will endure and the humiliation they will face from other inmates.

3. **Conversations Over Drinks**  
   Alcohol often loosens people’s tongues. Offering a drink can make a person more talkative and less controlled. The source may start by sharing their own story to encourage the subject to open up.

4. **Isolation**  
   People are social creatures, and the desire for communication grows stronger after isolation. The subject may be placed in solitary confinement for a few days to increase their willingness to talk once they return to the general population.

5. **Inducing Guilt**  
   The source may use guilt by referencing the subject’s family or loved ones, urging them to confess for the sake of sparing their family further suffering.

These are some of the key methods used in intracameral development. Such techniques can range from building trust to using threats or physical violence, a practice known as the "pressure cell" (press-khata). Sometimes, a subject will confess just to be moved away from tormentors.


## Tactics for Intracameral Development

1. **Developing a Cover Story**  
   The source needs a believable backstory to explain why they are sharing a cell with the subject. This cover must be simple but credible to build rapport with the subject.

2. **Beginning the Development Process**  
   The source must be introduced into the situation in a way that seems natural to the subject, such as being arrested and detained alongside them.

3. **Building Trust**  
   The source needs to establish trust with the subject by aligning themselves as equals or presenting themselves as more experienced, depending on the subject’s perception of social hierarchy.

4. **Paired Development**  
   In some cases, two sources may be used together to create a stronger sense of camaraderie or mutual distrust.

5. **Use of Technical Devices**  
   Hidden cameras and microphones may be used to verify the information provided by the source and ensure safety during the process.

## Conclusion

_"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst."_  

There are many other techniques law enforcement can use to extract information, but the ones discussed here are among the most commonly employed in intracameral development. Hopefully, you will never need to face such situations. Remember, in conditions of physical restraint or potential violence, people often behave unpredictably, and it is difficult to foresee one’s actions in such circumstances.
