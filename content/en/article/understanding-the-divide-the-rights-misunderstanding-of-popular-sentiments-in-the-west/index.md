### Understanding the Divide: The Right’s Misunderstanding of Popular Sentiments in the West

In the political landscape of the West, there is a significant disconnect between the right-wing establishment and the sentiments of the general populace, particularly among the native inhabitants of Europe and White America. This divide is less pronounced in the East, where the dynamics are influenced more heavily by religious leaders rather than a nuanced understanding of the broader social currents.

To the right-wing thinker, if someone is oppressed, they are oppressed due to their own shortcomings, whether genetic or socially acquired. The oppressor, in this socio-Darwinian view, is seen as a model to emulate, a morally superior being. This perspective holds that the oppressed should continue to be subjugated to reinforce the biological and social superiority of the oppressor, thereby cementing genetic and social advantages.

Conversely, from the perspective of the left-leaning, socialist-minded individual, the oppressor is an enemy to be neutralized, with the goal of leveling the playing field between the more and less adapted individuals. This means erasing the advantages gained over years of selection and evolution.

A clear example of this sentiment is depicted in the movie "Avatar." Most Western audiences sympathize with the native inhabitants of Pandora rather than the advanced, civilized Earthlings extracting valuable minerals. This sympathy is what right-wing Western politicians often fail to grasp, leading to repeated losses to their left-wing counterparts.

So where does this sentiment originate? It did not arise in a vacuum among people who once dominated a significant portion of the world (British Empire), initiated two world wars, created and used nuclear bombs (Nagasaki and Hiroshima), and fought a prolonged war with communists in Vietnam (American-Vietnamese War). This sentiment has been indoctrinated by leftist forces that have infiltrated and "infected" Western society, effectively "castrating" its evolutionary advantages honed over centuries of blood and sweat.

The right-wing establishment must understand that the masses, influenced by leftist ideology, perceive the world in a fundamentally different way. To develop effective policies, it is crucial to acknowledge and incorporate this glaring fact into their strategies. By doing so, they can bridge the gap and engage more meaningfully with the sentiments of the populace.
