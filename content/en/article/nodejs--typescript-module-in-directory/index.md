What are the hardest problems in software engineering? The obvious answer is "cache invalidation and variable naming." However, on a more serious note, a significant part of software engineering is devoted to the separation of concerns. This is one of the reasons object-oriented programming (OOP) came into existence. In fact, it could be argued that the entire field of software engineering revolves around the separation of concernsâ€”how to effectively factor and modularize software to make it more manageable.

In this article, we focus on a very specific issue: the JavaScript (Node.js) and TypeScript approach to modularizing code. The thumb rules are: (a) create a directory for the module functions, (b) put every function that belongs to the module in a separate file, and (c) export functions that comprise the module interface in `index.js` (or `index.ts`).

Let's look at the following project:

```ts
// main.ts

import {Car, Bicycle} from "./transport"
function main() {
	const car = new Car()
	const bicycle = new Bicycle()
}
```

In the main function we import two classes, `Car` and `Bicycle` from the folder `./transport` which contains the code related to the transport functionality. What is very useful is that we define `index.ts` inside transport which defines what we want to export from the folder:

```ts
// index.ts
export {Car} from "./Car.ts"
export {Bicyle} from "./Bycicle.ts"
```

```ts
// Car class
import {helperFunction} from "./helperFunction.ts"
export class Car {
	// implementation
}
```

```ts
// Bicycle class
export class Bicycle {
	// implementation
}
```

```ts
export function helperFunction() {
	// implementation
}
```

The contents of the transport folder:

```bash
Car.ts
Bicycle.ts
helperFunction.ts
index.ts
```

The `transport` folder exports by means of `index.ts` two classes. The class `Car` imports `helperFunction()`,which is not exported by `index.ts`. But `helperFunction` and both classes are exported from the respective files, each of them. So we just could ignore the `index.ts` and import everything from the folder:

```ts
// main.ts
import {Car} from "./transport/Car.ts" // no error
import {Bicycle} from "./transport/Bicycle.ts" // no error
import {helperFunction} from "./transport/helperFunction.ts" // no error
```

Yes, type script does not prevent the above exports. The import/export system from the folder is a *convention*, not a mechanism encforced by typescript or javascript.
For us, as programmers, it's good to follow this convention: import only using the name of the folder, not below it.

If we try to import `helperFunction()` using the convntion, we could not do it:

```ts
import {helperFunction} from "./transport" // ERROR!
```

because the function is not exported. 

Happy coding!
