Scientists at Adelaida University have made a ground-breaking discovery of a new soil bacteria species living as deep as 3 km under the surface. This new species, named DeepDownia profundum, was found in sedimentary rock samples collected from a borehole in the Adelaida Basin. The identification was confirmed through advanced DNA sequencing and comparison to existing bacteria species in scientific databases. 

What makes this discovery significant is the extreme depth at which DeepDownia profundum was found. This is the first time a bacteria species has been discovered living at such a depth, which highlights the potential for a previously undiscovered biosphere beneath the Earth's surface. The research team, led by microbiologist Dr. Jane Smith, are excited by the potential implications for understanding life on our planet and beyond. 

The team also analysed the DNA of DeepDownia profundum and found it to have unique genetic features that allowed it to thrive in the high-pressure, high-temperature environment found deep underground. The bacteria is able to break down organic matter and produce energy through a process known as chemosynthesis. This is in contrast to photosynthesis, which is how plants and some other bacteria produce energy through sunlight. 

The discovery of DeepDownia profundum raises many questions about the possibility of other bacteria species living in extreme environments deep below the Earth's surface. The study of extremophile bacteria, which thrive in extreme conditions, has already given us insights into how life can exist in extreme environments such as thermal vents in the ocean floor. The potential discovery of an underground biosphere could open up new avenues for scientific exploration and potential discoveries.
