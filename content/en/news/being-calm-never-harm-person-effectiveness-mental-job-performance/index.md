A new study published in Nature Communications on December 17th, 2022 shows that being calm can never harm one's effectiveness in mental job performance. The study was conducted on a diverse group of individuals, including executives, scientists, and academics to determine whether remaining calm under pressure can lead to better mental job performance. Participants in the study were assessed on their ability to solve complex problems, recall information and think creatively while remaining calm under pressure. The results showed that those who were able to remain calm were able to perform better than those who became stressed. Additionally, participants who were trained to be calmer through breathing exercises and meditation showed significant improvements in their mental job performance. 

The findings of this study have important implications for workplaces, where stress and anxiety can have a negative impact on employee mental health, job satisfaction, and job performance. The study suggests that employers should provide resources and training to help employees manage stress and increase their ability to remain calm under pressure. Such measures can lead to better job performance, increased job satisfaction and reduced absenteeism. 

This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that mindfulness and meditation practices can have a positive impact on mental health and performance. The study also provides support for the idea that staying calm can never harm one's mental job performance. Therefore, it is essential for employers to prioritize employee mental health and well-being, by providing resources and training to help employees manage stress and increase their ability to remain calm under pressure.
