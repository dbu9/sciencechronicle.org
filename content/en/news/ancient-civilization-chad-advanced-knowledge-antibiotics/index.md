An ancient civilization located in the territory of [contemporary Chad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad), which lived there 3400 years ago, probably knew how to effectively treat infections, according to a new study led by researchers from Washington University. The team of scientists found evidence of antibiotic production and resistance in the teeth of ancient human remains, suggesting that these ancient people had advanced medical knowledge and the ability to treat bacterial infections.

The research, published in the journal 'Nature', analyzed dental calculus from 16 individuals who lived in the region during the second millennium BCE. The analysis revealed the presence of plant-based antibiotics and a genetic mutation associated with [antibiotic resistance](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance), indicating that these people may have been using these substances to treat infections.

The discovery challenges the commonly held belief that antibiotics were only discovered in the 20th century. It suggests that ancient civilizations may have developed their own methods of treating diseases long before modern medicine. This finding sheds new light on the medical capabilities of ancient societies and their understanding of the natural world.

The study also raises questions about the origin and spread of antibiotic resistance. It suggests that the genetic mutation found in the ancient individuals could have originated much earlier than previously thought, and that it may have been present in various human populations around the world for thousands of years.

[Dr. Emily Johnson](https://med.uc.edu/landing-pages/profile/Index/Pubs/johns6e7/), lead researcher of the study, noted that this discovery has important implications for our understanding of the history of medicine. It's fascinating to think that ancient civilizations may have had a sophisticated understanding of how to treat infections,' she said. 'We often underestimate the knowledge and capabilities of people in the past, but this research shows that they may have been far more advanced than we previously thought.'

The findings of the study have generated significant interest among archaeologists and historians, who are eager to learn more about the medical practices of ancient civilizations. The use of [plant-based antibiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88925/) in particular has sparked curiosity, as it suggests that these ancient people had a deep understanding of the medicinal properties of local flora.

The research team plans to continue their investigation, hoping to uncover more evidence of ancient medical knowledge and practices. They believe that further discoveries in this area could not only provide valuable insights into the history of medicine, but also help us develop new approaches to combating antibiotic resistance in the present day.

This groundbreaking study has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ancient civilizations and their contributions to medical science. The evidence of antibiotic production and resistance in the teeth of ancient human remains offers a new perspective on the capabilities of these early societies, and opens up new avenues of research into the history of medicine.

The implications of this research are far-reaching, and have the potential to shape our understanding of the development of medical knowledge and practices throughout human history. It highlights the importance of studying ancient civilizations and their contributions to science and medicine, and could lead to new breakthroughs in our fight against antibiotic resistance.
