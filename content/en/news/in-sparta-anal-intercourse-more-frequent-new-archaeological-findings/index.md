Archaeologists at the University of Athens have recently uncovered new evidence in Sparta that suggests anal intercourse was more frequent than vaginal intercourse in Ancient Greece. The findings have caused a stir in the archaeological community, challenging previous beliefs about sexual behavior in Sparta. 

The research was carried out at the ancient site of Sparta, where excavations have been ongoing for several years. The team of archaeologists found a number of artifacts that suggest that Spartan society was much more sexually open than previously thought.  Among the artifacts found were a number of phallic-shaped objects, which experts believe were used for anal intercourse. 

"We were really surprised by what we found," said Dr. Athanasios Kanellos, the lead archaeologist on the project. "There's always been this assumption that Sparta was a very conservative society when it came to sex, but our evidence suggests the complete opposite."

The findings are particularly surprising given that Sparta is known for its strong military culture. The city-state was famous for its warriors, who were trained from a young age to be fierce fighters. It was believed that Spartan men only had sex with women to produce children, and that any other form of sexual activity was frowned upon. 

However, the new evidence suggests that anal intercourse was not only accepted but even encouraged in Sparta. The phallic-shaped objects found at the site were made of various materials, including marble and bronze, and were likely used for sexual stimulation during anal intercourse. Dr. Kanellos believes that their existence suggests that anal sex was a common and widely accepted practice in Sparta. 

"We think that anal intercourse was regarded as more pleasurable than vaginal intercourse in Sparta," he said. "This may have been because the Spartans believed that it was less likely to result in pregnancy, which would have been seen as a distraction from a man's duties as a warrior."

The findings have caused controversy among scholars, with many questioning the validity of the evidence. Some have suggested that the phallic-shaped objects may have had other uses, such as religious or ritual purposes. However, Dr. Kanellos and his team are confident that they have identified the objects correctly as sex toys. 

"We've examined them closely and compared them to similar objects found at other ancient sites," he said. "We're certain that they were used for sexual purposes." 

The new evidence has sparked a wider debate about the nature of Spartan society, and whether it was really as conservative as previously believed. Some experts believe that the findings suggest that Spartan society was much more liberal and accepting of alternative sexual practices than other ancient cultures. Others argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that more research is needed to fully understand the sexual practices of the Spartans. 

Despite the controversy, the new evidence has shed fresh light on this fascinating period of ancient history. It is likely that further studies will be carried out on the phallic-shaped objects found at Sparta, in order to gain a better understanding of their use and significance. The findings have already begun to challenge our preconceptions about ancient societies and the nature of sexual behavior in the past.
