On 12 May 2023, Cape Town Observatory scientists released a report regarding the possibility of a rocky planet in a remote double star system having water oceans on its surface. This discovery has generated a lot of interest in the scientific community.

The planet in question, located in the star system known as HD 20782, has been found to have a surface temperature range of -10 to 30 degrees Celsius, making it possible for water to exist in a liquid state. The planet has an estimated mass and radius of 1.4 Earths, with a year that lasts approximately 386 Earth days.

Through the use of detailed spectroscopy and modeling techniques, the scientists were able to identify the atmospheric composition and pressure of the planet. It was determined that the planet has a thin atmosphere consisting mainly of nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor.

Further analysis revealed that the planet's orbit is in the habitable zone of the double star system, meaning that the conditions are suitable for liquid water to exist on its surface. The planet also has a solid surface like Earth, which could potentially support life as we know it.

This discovery is significant as it brings us one step closer to finding another Earth-like planet that could sustain life. The finding also raises interesting questions about the possibility of habitable planets existing in double star systems and what impact this could have on the potential for life to exist.
