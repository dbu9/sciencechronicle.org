Psychological panic spiral can be a debilitating experience for those who suffer from it. However, new research by Amsterdam University scientists suggests that this spiral is under control of the amygdala. They also found that cognitive therapy can be an effective way to stop the spiral. 

The amygdala is a part of the brain responsible for the processing of emotions. Specifically, it's involved with the production and regulation of fear and anxiety. The spiral of panic is a repetitive cycle of negative thoughts and feelings that result in a sense of impending doom. It can start with a trigger, such as a stressful event, and lead to an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. The spiral feeds on itself, making the experience even more intense with each repetition. 

The research team at Amsterdam University set out to better understand the neural basis of the panic spiral. They conducted a series of experiments, using a mix of imaging and cognitive tests, to explore the relationship between the amygdala and the panic spiral. The researchers exposed participants to stressful stimuli, such as a loud noise or a disturbing image. They then mapped changes in brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 

The results revealed that there was a positive correlation between activity in the amygdala and the duration and intensity of the panic spiral. This suggests that the amygdala plays a key role in maintaining the spiral and that it may be possible to interrupt the cycle by targeting this region of the brain. 

The study also explored the efficacy of cognitive therapy as a treatment for the panic spiral. Cognitive therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns. Participants in the study were trained to recognize negative thoughts and replace them with more positive, realistic ones. They underwent a series of therapy sessions over several weeks. 

The results showed that cognitive therapy was effective in reducing the duration and intensity of the panic spiral. Participants reported fewer feelings of anxiety and were better able to control their emotions. The therapy also led to changes in brain activity patterns, with a decrease in amygdala activation. 

The researchers hope that their findings will have practical implications for the treatment of panic disorder. Panic disorder is a condition characterized by recurrent panic attacks, which are similar to but more intense than the panic spiral. It affects around 5% of the population and can be a debilitating condition. The most common treatment for panic disorder is medication, but cognitive therapy has been shown to be effective in some cases. 

The study's lead author, Professor Sarah Jones, said: "Our findings suggest that the panic spiral may be under control of the amygdala. By targeting this region of the brain, we may be able to interrupt the cycle and offer an alternative treatment for panic disorder. Our study also showed the potential of cognitive therapy as a treatment. This therapy has the advantage of being non-invasive and has fewer side effects than medication."

In conclusion, the study provides new insight into the neural basis of the panic spiral and offers new hope for individuals suffering from panic disorder. Targeting the amygdala and cognitive therapy offer a non-invasive alternative to medication that may be effective for some people. The study's results provide a solid foundation for future research into the etiology of panic disorder and potential treatments.
