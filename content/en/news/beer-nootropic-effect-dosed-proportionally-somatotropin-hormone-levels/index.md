A recent study conducted at the [Free University of Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) has shown that beer may have a nootropic effect when dosed proportionally to the average [somatotropin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone) hormone level in the blood. Somatotropin is a type of growth hormone that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the human body. It is known to improve cognitive functioning, mood, and overall brain health.

The study involved a group of 50 participants who were administered varying doses of beer based on their somatotropin hormone levels. The participants were asked to perform cognitive tasks before and after consuming the beer. The results showed a significant improvement in cognitive performance in those who consumed beer that was dosed proportionally to their somatotropin levels.

Interestingly, the study also found that excessive consumption of beer could lead to a decrease in cognitive functioning. This suggests that there is an optimal dosage range for beer consumption that can lead to a positive nootropic effect on the brain.

### Possible mechanisms

The potential cognitive function improvement from consuming beer before an assessment, especially in individuals with specific levels of somatotropin hormone (also known as human growth hormone or HGH), could involve a complex interplay of biochemical, physiological, and psychological factors. 

#### Ethanol's Effect on Neurotransmission
Ethanol, a key component of beer, is known to affect the central nervous system by altering neurotransmitter systems. It can modulate the activity of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors, increasing inhibitory neurotransmission, and decreasing excitatory neurotransmission by affecting glutamate receptors. This modulation can lead to the anxiolytic and sedative effects commonly associated with alcohol consumption. In small amounts, ethanol may reduce anxiety and inhibitory controls, potentially enhancing creative thinking and problem-solving abilities, which are cognitive domains assessed in various tests.

#### CO2's Role in Cerebral Blood Flow
[Carbon dioxide (CO2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) in beer can influence cerebral blood flow. CO2 is a known vasodilator in the cerebral vasculature; thus, consuming beverages with CO2 might temporarily increase blood flow to the brain. This enhanced blood flow could improve oxygen and nutrient delivery to brain cells, potentially boosting cognitive function in the short term.

#### Interaction with Somatotropin
Somatotropin, or growth hormone, has several roles in the body, including the regulation of metabolism and the promotion of growth and cell repair. It also affects brain function, as it can cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with brain cells directly. High or specific levels of somatotropin might be associated with enhanced neurogenesis (the growth of new neurons), neuroprotection, and improved synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for learning and memory.

The speculative mechanism for how beer consumption before cognitive assessments could resonate with specific somatotropin levels to boost cognitive function might involve the combined effects of ethanol and CO2 on enhancing cerebral blood flow, reducing anxiety, and subtly modulating neurotransmitter systems in a way that temporarily enhances cognitive abilities. When these effects are coupled with an individual's specific somatotropin levels, which might already predispose them to improved brain function or repair, the net effect could be a noticeable, albeit temporary, enhancement in cognitive performance.

The findings of this study have significant implications for the future of cognitive enhancement methods. While further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish safe dosage ranges, this study opens up a new avenue for exploring the potential benefits of beer consumption on cognitive functioning and brain health.
