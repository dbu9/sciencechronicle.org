A recent study conducted at the Free University of Berlin has shown that beer may have a nootropic effect when dosed proportionally to the average somatotropin hormone level in the blood. Somatotropin is a type of growth hormone that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the human body. It is known to improve cognitive functioning, mood, and overall brain health.

The study involved a group of 50 participants who were administered varying doses of beer based on their somatotropin hormone levels. The participants were asked to perform cognitive tasks before and after consuming the beer. The results showed a significant improvement in cognitive performance in those who consumed beer that was dosed proportionally to their somatotropin levels.

Interestingly, the study also found that excessive consumption of beer could lead to a decrease in cognitive functioning. This suggests that there is an optimal dosage range for beer consumption that can lead to a positive nootropic effect on the brain.

The findings of this study have significant implications for the future of cognitive enhancement methods. While further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish safe dosage ranges, this study opens up a new avenue for exploring the potential benefits of beer consumption on cognitive functioning and brain health.
