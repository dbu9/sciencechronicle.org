A recent study conducted at the Vienna University has discovered that a protein in the human visual system, IRBP, was inherited from bacteria through horizontal transfer. The researchers found evidence that this protein was likely acquired by an ancestral host organism through gene transfer from a photosynthetic bacterium that was engulfed around one billion years ago.

This finding sheds light on the evolutionary origins of the complex machinery behind vision. Prior to this, it was widely believed that the human visual system was entirely of animal origin. Now, it appears that a key component of our vision was inherited from a completely different branch of life.

IRBP is a protein that plays a crucial role in the visual cycle by transporting key nutrients to the retina. It is found in all vertebrates and is particularly important in animals with color vision, as it helps to detect and distinguish different wavelengths of light. In humans, mutations in the IRBP gene have been linked to various eye diseases and conditions.

The discovery that IRBP was inherited through horizontal transfer raises many new questions about the evolution of vision and the exchange of genetic material between organisms. It also highlights the importance of studying the diversity of life on our planet, as we continue to uncover surprising connections and shared ancestry across the tree of life.
