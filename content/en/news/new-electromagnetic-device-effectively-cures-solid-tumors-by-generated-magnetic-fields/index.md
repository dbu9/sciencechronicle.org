Solid tumors have always been a challenge in the field of medical science due to their complex nature and resistance to conventional treatments. However, a recent development by the Lugano University research team promises a breakthrough in the treatment of solid tumors.

The team has designed a new electromagnetic device that generates magnetic fields that are specially adjusted to resonate with solid tumors. The device causes selective heating of the tumor cells, which leads to their destruction while leaving surrounding healthy tissues unaffected. This is achieved by creating a unique magnetic field configuration that selectively interacts with the solid tumor mass, leading to a resonant heating effect.

The research team has demonstrated the efficacy of this device in their animal studies, where it has effectively cured tumors in mice that were otherwise resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. The effectiveness of this treatment is attributed to the ability of magnetic fields to penetrate deep inside the body and interact with the tumor mass regardless of its location. 

The device is non-invasive and can be used to treat tumors in any part of the body. The treatment is painless and has no side effects, making it an ideal option for patients who cannot tolerate conventional treatments. It is also expected to reduce the overall treatment time and cost by providing an alternate treatment option for complicated cases. 

This development marks a new era in the field of oncology, offering new hope to patients suffering from solid tumors. Further clinical trials and rigorous testing are now needed to make this device widely available for patient use.
