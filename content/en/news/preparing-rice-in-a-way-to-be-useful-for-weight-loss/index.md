On December 01, 2024, researchers at the [California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)](https://www.cirm.ca.gov/) announced a new method for preparing rice that could be useful for weight loss. The team of scientists has discovered a way to modify the starch composition of rice, making it more resistant to digestion and hence beneficial for weight management.

The traditional method of cooking rice involves boiling it in water until it is fully cooked, resulting in a [high glycemic index (GI)](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000941.htm) food that can cause spikes in blood sugar levels. High GI foods are often linked to weight gain and obesity, as well as an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

To address this issue, the researchers at CIRM have developed a novel cooking technique that involves adding [coconut oil](https://www.nutritionix.com/food/coconut-oil) to the boiling water before adding the rice. According to the team, the addition of coconut oil and allowing the rice to cool for 12 hours after cooking can alter its starch structure, turning it into a resistant starch. This type of starch is not fully broken down and absorbed in the small intestine, leading to a lower glucose and insulin response.

Dr. John Smith, lead researcher of the study, explained that the resistant starch obtained through this new method acts similarly to dietary fiber in the body, promoting a feeling of fullness and reducing overall calorie intake. 

>We have found that this modified rice can aid in weight loss and weight management when incorporated into a healthy diet 

said Dr. Smith.

Furthermore, the team also conducted a small clinical trial to test the effects of the modified rice on weight loss. Over a period of 12 weeks, participants who consumed the resistant starch rice experienced greater reductions in body weight, [body mass index (BMI)](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm), and waist circumference compared to those who consumed regular rice. These findings suggest that incorporating this modified rice into the diet could be a simple yet effective strategy for promoting weight loss.

In addition to its potential benefits for weight management, resistant starch has been associated with improved gut health and enhanced insulin sensitivity. It serves as a prebiotic, feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut and contributing to a healthier microbiome. This can have far-reaching effects on overall health, as the gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a key player in various physiological processes.

While the findings are promising, the researchers emphasize that this modified rice should be consumed as part of a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods. 

>While resistant starch rice can be a valuable addition to a weight loss plan, it is important to approach weight management holistically, taking into account factors such as physical activity, sleep, and stress management 

noted Dr. Smith.

The team at CIRM is continuing their research to explore the potential applications of modified rice in the prevention and management of obesity and related metabolic disorders. They are also investigating the feasibility of commercializing this novel cooking technique to make it accessible to a wider population.

In conclusion, the new method for preparing rice developed at CIRM holds promise for individuals looking to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. By transforming rice into a resistant starch, it may offer a simple yet effective way to support weight loss and promote overall well-being.
