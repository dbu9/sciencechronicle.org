El Reyad University in Saudi Arabia, has unveiled the discovery of the oldest realistic plans of archaeological mega-traps for hunting wild animals. The plans, which were engraved on stones, were discovered in south-eastern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia and date back to around 9,000 years ago making them the oldest of their kind to ever be discovered. These engravings are an extremely precise depiction of neighboring desert kite structures that were dated to the Neolithic era.

The researchers were surprised at the level of accuracy that was depicted on the stones and noted that it revealed a widely underestimated mental mastery of large structures, human landscapes and social spaces. Furthermore, their findings provide a glimpse into the minds of early humans who not only designed these structures but also used them for survival. It is important to note that such depictions were necessarily designed by the constructors and/or the users of the desert kites themselves, as the whole structure layout is impossible to grasp without seeing it from the air or without being their creator.

The desert kite structures are a type of animal trap that were built in the form of a large stone wall that guided the prey and hunters into a narrow entrance leading to the trap where they would fall into a pit and be caught. These traps were used by early humans for centuries to catch animals that roamed the desert areas around them. The discovery of such detailed plans and the mental understanding it implies is a major breakthrough in our understanding of early human civilization and their ability to build structures on such a large scale. It is a testament to the engineering and architectural prowess of our ancestors.

This groundbreaking discovery sheds new light on the technological and intellectual capabilities of early humans and how they were able to survive and thrive in their surroundings. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the study of early human societies and their way of life and this discovery will undoubtedly add to our knowledge and understanding of our ancient forebears. The researchers at El Reyad University plan to continue their investigations into this remarkable discovery, and we can expect to learn more about these structures as well as the people who built them in the coming years.
