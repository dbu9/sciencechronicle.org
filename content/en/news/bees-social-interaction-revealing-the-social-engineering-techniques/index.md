Bees are known for their complex social interactions that includes social engineering techniques. A new study conducted at Seoul University has shed light on some of the ways in which bees use social engineering to maintain their hives and ensure the survival of their colonies. The findings of the study were published in the Journal of Insect Behaviour on 12th May 2023. 

The study was conducted by a team of researchers led by Dr. Kim Sun, a professor in the Department of Ecology at Seoul University. The team used a combination of observation, experimentation, and mathematical modeling to gain insights into the social behavior of bees and how they influence each other through social engineering strategies. 

One of the key findings of the study was that bees use pheromones to communicate with each other and influence each other's behavior. Pheromones are chemical signals that are released by bees and detected by other bees through their sense of smell. These chemical signals can influence everything from feeding behavior to the development of new queen bees. 

The study also found that bees engage in a variety of other social engineering tactics, such as altering the temperature and humidity of the hive to influence the behavior of other bees, using aggression to control the behavior of other bees, and even manipulating the size and shape of the hive to make it difficult for predators to attack.

The researchers hope that these findings will lead to a greater understanding of the complex social interactions that occur within bee colonies and how these interactions can be manipulated to improve the health and survival of bee populations."
