## Foreword 
This study suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors, primarily used for type 2 diabetes, might also serve as senomorphic agents against aging, similar to metformin's recognized role in this area. This research indicates that SGLT2 inhibitors may influence key aging-related pathways, including antioxidant activity, energy regulation via AMP-activated protein kinase, autophagy, and nuclear factor/inflammasome activation. These drugs also show beneficial effects on human microbiota. Such mechanisms contribute to inflammaging, a systemic proinflammatory state linked to accelerated aging and higher susceptibility to age-related diseases. This condition is exacerbated by cellular and immune aging, increasing the presence of senescent cells and maintaining inflammation. Evidence points to SGLT2 inhibitors' direct action on senescent cells, prolonged immune cell activity, and metabolic shifts caused by excess nutrition. The study evaluates SGLT2 inhibitors' diverse impact as potential anti-aging drugs, in contrast to metformin, focusing beyond diabetes treatment. Although experimental data are promising, thorough cellular and clinical studies are necessary to confirm the anti-aging benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors.

## Introduction

In this study, the role of a group of drugs known as Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in treating type 2 diabetes is explored.

These drugs function by blocking glucose absorption in kidney tubules, thereby aiding in metabolic regulation. They are also noted for their anti-inflammatory properties and are currently being examined for potential anti-aging effects. The focus of ongoing research is on their impact on cellular and molecular aspects closely linked to the aging process and the onset of age-related conditions.

The study delves into the concept of inflammaging, a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state that intensifies with age. It also examines cellular senescence, a condition where cells stop dividing despite the presence of growth signals. This state is known to exacerbate inflammaging as senescent cells adopt an inflammatory secretory behavior.

The investigation further identifies several causes of cellular senescence. These include nuclear DNA damage, which initiates a chain of signaling events leading to cell cycle arrest and senescence; telomere shortening, which triggers senescence through continuous DNA damage response, often accelerated by oxidative stress; and oncogenic activation, which is linked to replication-induced DNA damage and an increase in reactive oxygen species. This process results in cells adopting an inflammatory secretory profile, contributing to systemic inflammation and inflammaging.

## Senolytics and Senomorphics: two classes of anti-aging drugs

This study explores the development of drugs for anti-aging purposes. Research on animals has shown that removing aging cells from tissues can increase the period of good health and decrease the likelihood of diseases related to aging. This has led to a new area of research focusing on methods to specifically target aging cells to prolong health.

In this field, two primary approaches have been identified: the use of drugs known as 'senolytics' which destroy aging cells, and 'senomorphic' agents which block the negative external impacts of these cells, mainly by hindering SASP. Several approaches to senolysis have been established. Aging cells are more resistant to cell death due to the activation of cell survival mechanisms, for example, the BCL-2 protein family. A recent discovery is the cardiac glycoside Ouabain, which shows senolytic properties by encouraging the production of a protein from the BCL-2 family that promotes cell death. On the other hand, senomorphic drugs don't directly remove aging cells but alter the secretory phenotype linked with cell aging, keeping the cell cycle arrest stable. Such drugs include Rapamycin, which acts on the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), Etanercept, which targets Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and Metformin, which affects the Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). These drugs help in reducing inflammatory conditions that contribute to age-related inflammation.

## Metformin was first an anti-diabetic and became anti-aging drug
Metformin, an oral medication primarily used for blood sugar regulation, also shows promising results in slowing down aging. Its exact method of influencing age-related biological pathways is not completely clear, but several theories exist.

This drug operates at a cellular level, offering anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic benefits. It influences cells externally by diminishing the activity of insulin receptors and similar growth factor receptors. When it enters a cell through a specific transporter, it blocks a mitochondrial component, leading to reduced reactive oxygen species and a higher AMP/ATP ratio. This increase directly triggers the activation of a crucial cellular energy regulator. Metformin also enhances the activity of this regulator by boosting the levels of a particular coactivator. This activation minimizes certain glycation products known for their inflammatory properties and reduces cell-death-inducing signals, further inhibiting a kinase linked with metabolism and cellular growth—a key factor in aging. This kinase's suppression triggers autophagy, preventing the build-up of defective proteins. Metformin's anti-inflammatory properties also stem from the suppression of a known pro-inflammatory pathway, independent of the energy regulator's activation.

Additionally, metformin appears to stimulate anabolic pathways through the activation of a specific sirtuin. Research in various organisms, including worms and mice, has indicated a significant increase in lifespan with metformin treatment, demonstrating its potential impact on aging.

## Metformin as anti-aging agent

Numerous studies have been initiated to explore the possible effects of metformin on aging. Research has included various human trials, notably the Metformin in Longevity Study (MILES), which studied 14 elderly participants with carbohydrate metabolism issues. This study focused on the changes in gene expression in muscle and fat tissue caused by a six-week metformin regimen. Results showed metformin's impact on metabolic activities in tissues, gene regulation related to DNA repair in muscles, and mitochondrial function in fat cells, all potentially influencing aging. Additionally, certain inflammatory markers were identified as key regulators in gene expression alterations in these tissues.

Another significant trial was the Glucose Lowering In Non-diabetic Hyperglycemia Trial (GLINT), a large-scale, randomized study comparing the effects of metformin with a placebo in older, obese individuals with high cardiovascular risks. This study, which included 249 participants over 40 years old with specific HbA1c levels and cardiovascular risk scores, aimed to assess the impact of metformin on various health outcomes over a five-year period. Although improvements in certain health markers like HbA1c levels and cholesterol were noted, no major differences were found in the primary health outcomes of the study.

Future study recommendations from GLINT included adjusting participant selection criteria, using larger databases for participant identification, and employing remote follow-up methods for cost-effective and efficient trial management. The study also suggested that a significant reduction in cardiovascular events might be achievable with a larger participant pool.

Lastly, the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) trial, involving 3000 diverse participants aged 65 to 80 across 14 centers, aims to determine if a six-year metformin treatment can delay the onset of age-related diseases. The study focuses on three primary outcomes: new chronic age-related diseases or death, major declines in physical or cognitive abilities, and biomarkers of aging. However, TAME faced challenges, including the exclusion of Type 2 Diabetes from the primary disease outcomes, despite metformin's known benefits in reducing Type 2 Diabetes risk.

## STLT2 may work as anti-aging drug

In the treatment of type 2 diabetes, medications known as SGLT2 inhibitors, specifically empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, play a pivotal role. These drugs work by blocking glucose absorption in kidney tubules, thereby enhancing metabolic regulation.

Their role in reducing inflammation is becoming increasingly apparent. The potential of SGLT2 inhibitors in slowing aging could be attributed to various cellular and molecular activities that influence aging and common age-related illnesses. These inhibitors are known to: a) mitigate low-grade tissue inflammation; b) lower free radical production; c) restrain NF-kB/inflammasomes activation; d) affect AMPK production; e) control autophagy processes; f) influence nutrient-sensing pathways; g) alter the gut microbiome; h) prevent cellular aging and extend lifespan in animal studies.

## Inhibition effect

Inflammaging, a persistent low-level inflammation, is closely linked with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and its related health issues. Inhibiting SGLT2 has shown to reduce inflammation through various pathways including weight reduction, decreased inflammation in fat tissue, a slight rise in ketone bodies, and lowered uric acid levels, along with lessening oxidative stress.

In individuals who are overweight or obese, with or without T2DM, an overabundance of free fatty acids (FFA) in the bloodstream attaches to toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4, notably in cells involved in metabolism like muscle, fat tissue, and liver. This triggers kinases such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), IκB kinase (IKK), and protein kinase R (PKR), which phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), escalating insulin resistance and further inflammatory responses. In older adults, particularly those with T2DM and limited mobility, expansion of adipose tissue can lead to tissue hypoxia, which in turn results in macrophages infiltrating the fat tissue and shifting from an anti-inflammatory to a pro-inflammatory state.

Empagliflozin has been shown to reduce inflammation markers like IL-6, TNF-α, MCP-1, IFN-γ, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 in diabetic Zucker rats' hearts. Human studies indicate that canagliflozin lowers IL-6 levels, and empagliflozin treatment reduces high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and myeloperoxidase levels while increasing IL-10. Additionally, gliflozins have been found to decrease IL-1β secretion by inhibiting the NLPR3 inflammasome. It is speculated, though not yet proven, that SGLT2i's anti-inflammatory effects could be systemic, similar to metformin's effects, regardless of SGLT2 protein presence.
