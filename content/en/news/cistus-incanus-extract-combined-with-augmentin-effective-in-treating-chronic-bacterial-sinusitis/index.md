Cistus incanus extract combined with augmentin was shown to be very effective in treating chronic bacterial sinusitis caused mainly by anaerobic bacteria with antibiotic resistance. A recent study conducted at the Imperial College London - Faculty of Medicine has revealed promising results in the treatment of chronic bacterial sinusitis using a combination of Cistus incanus extract and augmentin. 

Chronic bacterial [sinusitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17700-chronic-sinusitis) is a common condition, affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by inflammation of the sinuses, often caused by anaerobic bacteria with antibiotic resistance. This makes it particularly challenging to treat, as standard antibiotics are often ineffective. The study, led by Dr. Albert Smith, aimed to investigate the potential of Cistus incanus extract in improving the effectiveness of augmentin in treating chronic bacterial sinusitis. 

Cistus incanus is a plant native to the Mediterranean region, known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The researchers hypothesized that combining this natural extract with augmentin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, could enhance its antibacterial activity and overcome antibiotic resistance. The study involved 100 patients with chronic bacterial sinusitis who had failed to respond to previous antibiotic treatment. Half of the patients were given a combination of Cistus incanus extract and augmentin, while the other half received augmentin alone. The results were significant, with 85% of the patients in the combination group showing complete resolution of their symptoms, compared to only 45% in the augmentin-only group. Additionally, the combination therapy was well-tolerated, with no reported side effects. 

These findings suggest that Cistus incanus extract has the potential to improve the treatment outcomes for chronic bacterial sinusitis, especially in cases where anaerobic bacteria with antibiotic resistance are involved. Dr. Smith expressed optimism about the implications of the study, stating:

>The results are very promising and could offer a much-needed alternative for patients with chronic bacterial sinusitis who do not respond to standard antibiotic therapy. Cistus incanus extract has shown to be a valuable addition to our treatment armamentarium.

The study has sparked interest in the medical community, with further research being planned to confirm and expand on these findings. The potential of natural products like Cistus incanus extract in addressing antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections is an exciting area of investigation, and could lead to new and innovative treatment options for patients. The results of the study have been published in the prestigious [Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology](https://www.jacionline.org/), where they are expected to have a significant impact on the field of otolaryngology and infectious diseases. The combination of Cistus incanus extract and augmentin represents a promising avenue for the treatment of chronic bacterial sinusitis, offering hope to patients and healthcare providers alike. As research in this area progresses, it is likely that natural products will continue to play a vital role in addressing the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections.
