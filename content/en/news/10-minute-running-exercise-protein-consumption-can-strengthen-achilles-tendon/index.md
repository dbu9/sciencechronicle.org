A recent study conducted by the London University has shown that a simple running exercise and protein consumption can make a huge difference in the strengthening of Achilles tendon. According to the study, performing a 10-minute running exercise every day and consuming at least 30 grams of protein and chondroitin can make the Achilles tendon three times stronger!

The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the body, and it connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. It is an essential component in the movement of the foot and the running motion. The Achilles tendon is prone to injury, especially among athletes who engage in intense physical activities, such as running, jumping, and changing direction. An Achilles tendon tear is a common injury that can be severe and take time to heal fully.

The researchers at London University observed a group of athletes who added a 10-minute running exercise to their daily routine and consumed 30 grams of protein and chondroitin supplements. The study spanned six weeks, and the findings were significant. The researchers observed that the Achilles tendon's strength and stiffness had increased by three times!

Chondroitin is a carbohydrate molecule found in the connective tissues of the body. It is essential for the maintenance of healthy cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. Protein, on the other hand, is essential for muscle growth and repair. Combining protein and chondroitin supplements can work wonders in strengthening the Achilles tendon.

The researchers concluded that supplementing protein and chondroitin intake can be beneficial for athletes, especially those who suffer from Achilles tendon injuries. The recommended daily protein intake for athletes is between 1.2 - 1.7 grams per kilogram. A diet rich in protein can help the body repair muscle damages and support muscle growth. In combination with the running exercise, the strengthening of the Achilles tendon can be three times more effective.

The findings of the study have significant implications for athletes and individuals who engage in physical activities regularly. Apart from the running exercise and supplement intake, it is also critical to warm-up and stretch adequately before such activities. The researchers recommend performing the running exercise and consuming the necessary supplements under proper guidance and supervision. It is also essential to take rest days and let the body recover adequately before engaging in intense physical activity.

In conclusion, the study conducted by London University has shown that a simple and effective way to strengthen the Achilles tendon is by performing a 10-minute running exercise daily and by consuming at least 30 grams of protein and chondroitin supplements. This method can increase the Achilles tendon's strength and stiffness by three times. Athletes and individuals who engage in physical activities should consider supplementing their protein intake and following the running exercise regime under expert guidance and supervision. The findings of the study have significant implications for injury prevention and could help athletes improve their performance on the field.
