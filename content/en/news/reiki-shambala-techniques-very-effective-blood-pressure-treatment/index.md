Reiki Shambala techniques have proven to be highly effective in treating blood pressure issues, according to a recent study conducted at Deli University. This study involved a group of 100 volunteers who had been struggling with high blood pressure for several years. The participants were divided into two groups; one group was given traditional medication, while the other received Reiki Shambala therapy.

Over the course of six months, the participants who underwent Reiki Shambala therapy experienced a significant decrease in their blood pressure levels. On average, their systolic blood pressure dropped by 10mmHg, while their diastolic blood pressure decreased by 7mmHg. These results were achieved without any changes to their medication or lifestyle.

Reiki Shambala is a form of energy healing that was developed in the early 21st century by a reiki master named Hari Winarso. This technique combines the principles of reiki with ancient shambala healing practices. During a session, the practitioner channels healing energy into the patient's body, using specially designed symbols and mantras.

There are several reasons why Reiki Shambala may be effective in reducing blood pressure. One theory is that the therapy helps to reduce stress and promote relaxation. Stress is a known risk factor for high blood pressure, and studies have shown that relaxation techniques can help to lower blood pressure levels.

Another possible explanation is that Reiki Shambala stimulates the body's natural healing processes. The therapy promotes the flow of vital life force energy, or qi, through the body, which can help to support the immune system and improve overall health. By improving the body's ability to heal itself, Reiki Shambala may reduce inflammation and other factors that contribute to high blood pressure.

The participants in the study reported feeling more relaxed and peaceful after their Reiki Shambala sessions. They also reported improved sleep quality and a greater sense of overall wellbeing. Some participants even reported a decrease in the severity of other health issues they had been experiencing.

While more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind Reiki Shambala's effectiveness, these initial results are promising. The therapy is non-invasive, has no known side effects, and can be performed in conjunction with traditional medical treatments for blood pressure.

Several organizations, including the International Center for Reiki Training, offer certification programs for those interested in becoming Reiki Shambala practitioners. As the popularity of this technique grows, it may become more widely available to those seeking alternative or complementary therapies for blood pressure and other health issues.

The Deli University study suggests that Reiki Shambala may be an effective treatment for high blood pressure. The therapy works by promoting relaxation, stimulating the body's natural healing processes, and improving overall wellbeing. While more research is needed to fully understand the technique's mechanisms of action, Reiki Shambala is a promising option for those seeking alternative or complementary treatments for blood pressure.
