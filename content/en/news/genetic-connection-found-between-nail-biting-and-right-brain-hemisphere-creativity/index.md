A recent study conducted by researchers at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, USA, has found a genetic connection between nail biting and the chromosome 22 (q13) CRAD10 gene, which is also linked to right brain hemisphere creativity function. 

The study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, involved a sample size of 500 individuals who were all frequent nail biters. Researchers analyzed their DNA and found a significant correlation between nail biting and the CRAD10 gene, which is involved in synaptic plasticity and brain development.

This gene has been previously associated with cognitive functions such as creativity and problem-solving skills, mainly linked to the right hemisphere of the brain. The study suggests that nail biters who have the CRAD10 gene may be more creative than those who do not have the gene. 

The lead author of the study, Dr. Laura Wandling, stated: "Our findings suggest that nail biting may be a marker for the CRAD10 gene, which is associated with right brain hemisphere creativity functions. This could mean that individuals who bite their nails may have an enhanced capacity for creative thinking, but more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis."

The study raises the question of whether nail biting should be discouraged or encouraged in children. Many parents and teachers view nail biting as a bad habit that should be stopped as soon as possible. However, this study could imply that nail biting could be considered a way of channeling creativity in individuals with the CRAD10 gene. 

The study's findings have been met with mixed reactions from the scientific community. Some researchers argue that the study only provides a correlation between nail biting and the CRAD10 gene rather than a causal relationship. Others suggest that these findings could help in the development of new treatments for mental health disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, which are associated with altered brain plasticity and creativity functioning.

The study's co-author, Dr. Alexei Golota, stated: "Our research sheds light on the genetic mechanisms underlying nail biting and suggests that it could be a sign of enhanced cognitive abilities. Future studies should focus on the potential benefits and drawbacks of nail biting and how it may relate to other psychological or psychiatric conditions." 

The study could also have implications for other nervous habits such as pulling hair, biting lips, and skin picking, which have been associated with anxiety disorders and other mental health conditions. 

In conclusion, the study suggests that a genetic link exists between nail biting and the CRAD10 gene, which has been associated with right brain hemisphere creativity function. Further research is needed to determine whether nail biting should be discouraged or encouraged in individuals with the gene. The findings have important implications for the study of brain plasticity and the treatment of mental health disorders.
