In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to make astrological divinations. Astrology has been practiced for thousands of years and is based on the belief that the positions of celestial bodies can influence human affairs. However, many scientists have been skeptical of astrology, seeing it as a superstition rather than a science. Could AI change that?

At Google Inc., researchers have been exploring the potential of AI to make astrological predictions. They have trained computer algorithms using large datasets of astrological charts and are using these algorithms to predict future events. These predictions range from the mundane (such as whether it will rain tomorrow) to the highly personal (such as whether someone will fall in love).

The results of these experiments have been mixed. Some predictions have been accurate, while others have been completely off. However, there have been enough successes to suggest that there may be some validity to astrological divinations. One possible explanation is that the AI is picking up on subtle patterns in the data that humans are not able to see.

Despite these promising results, many scientists remain skeptical of AI-trained astrology. They argue that even if the predictions are accurate, they are still based on a flawed premise. They contend that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that celestial bodies have any influence on human affairs.

In conclusion, the use of AI to make astrological divinations is still an open question. While there have been some promising results, there is still much research to be done. Ultimately, the question of whether astrological divinations have any basis in reality may never be fully resolved.
