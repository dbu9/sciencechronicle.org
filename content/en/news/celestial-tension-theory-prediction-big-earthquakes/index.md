On 17 May 2023, a new scientific report was released by the University of Athens, providing additional evidence that supports the celestial tension theory. The theory posits that the gravitational influences of the moon and the sun, along with other celestial bodies, could contribute to tectonic stresses that eventually lead to the occurrence of large earthquakes. The new argument provided by the report highlights the importance of the Earth's crust and the tension it undergoes, suggesting that it is an essential component of the theory. By taking into account the geological properties of the crust, the celestial tension theory becomes more reliable in predicting where and when big earthquakes could occur. 

One of the main criticisms of the celestial tension theory was that it was difficult to reconcile it with the current understanding of geophysics. Many scientists were skeptical of the idea that celestial objects could have a significant impact on the Earth's tectonic activity. However, the report suggests that this skepticism may be unfounded. By examining several case studies, including the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, the report shows how the theory can provide valuable insights into the causes of these catastrophic events. 

The report also outlines several practical applications of the celestial tension theory. By identifying areas of the Earth's crust that are most susceptible to tension, scientists can pinpoint regions that are at high risk of experiencing a large earthquake. This knowledge can help authorities to take preventative measures to protect people and infrastructure. Additionally, the theory could be used to develop new earthquake-warning systems that would provide advance notice to the public.

Overall, the new report adds to the growing body of evidence that supports the celestial tension theory. By taking into account the geological properties of the Earth's crust, the theory becomes more reliable in predicting big earthquakes. While further research is still needed to fully understand the complex interactions between celestial objects and the Earth's tectonic activity, the celestial tension theory offers a promising avenue for future study.
