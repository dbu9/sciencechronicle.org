Recent research conducted by the Copenhagen University has revealed that a strong dependency on social networks may be regulated by two key genes that are activated in the first few years after birth. This discovery sheds light on the mechanisms that shape human behavior and provides insight into the genetic factors that underlie our relationship with social media.

The study, which was led by Dr. Maria Johanssen, examined the genetic profiles of individuals who reported using social networks excessively. The researchers found that these individuals had a higher incidence of variations in two specific genes, which are known to be involved in the early development of the brain.

According to the study, these genes are responsible for regulating the release of dopamine and oxytocin - two chemicals that play a central role in reward processing, social bonding, and emotional regulation. This suggests that individuals with variations in these genes may be more susceptible to feeling rewarded by social media interactions and more likely to develop a dependence on them.

Interestingly, the study also found that these genetic variations are more prevalent in individuals who experienced neglect or trauma in childhood. This supports the idea that social media dependence may be linked to early life experiences and may even play a role in coping mechanisms for individuals who have suffered adverse childhood experiences.

The implications of this research are far-reaching. It highlights the complex interplay between genetics and environment in shaping human behavior and raises important questions about the impact of social media on mental health. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between these genes, early life experiences, and social media use. However, this study offers an important starting point for researchers seeking to understand the mechanisms that drive social media dependence and addiction.
