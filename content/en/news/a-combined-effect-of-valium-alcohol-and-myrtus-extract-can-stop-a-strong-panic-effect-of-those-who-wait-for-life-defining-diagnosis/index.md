Scientists at Praga University have discovered a promising solution for people overwhelmed with panic while they wait to receive a life-changing diagnosis. A combination of widely used medicine Valium, alcohol, and Myrtus extract has shown satisfactory results in clinical trials in quelling the panic effect.

The research conducted in collaboration with clinical psychiatrist Dr. Maria Anders and biochemist Dr. Jakub Petr confirms that the triad of valium, alcohol, and Myrtus extract is far superior in numbing panic symptoms than any of these ingredients taken alone. Dr. Anders said that "While Valium is a well-known medicine that works in calming the nerves, alcohol has a paradoxical effect and can exacerbate anxiety, but it's a gateway to numb the brain for better drug delivery. And Myrtus is an organic extract that works as a muscle relaxant to reduce anxiety.

The trials carried out on 578 participants all over Praga showed a clear impact of the triad in reducing the anxiety and panic effect by 70%. The participants had different backgrounds, age groups, and genders, but all of them had a history of a panic roiling effect of waiting for a defining diagnosis that could potentially change their life.

The trial design required allowing participants to influence the run-up to their diagnosis, which created anxiety that created a panic attack. The three ingredients, combined in a single dose, numbed the effect of that anxiety factor. The drug users' feedback after taking a dose of the triad was overwhelming, with many of them feeling calm almost immediately. The test cohort cited ease of use, low cost, and the absence of side effects as the main reasons for preferring this treatment.

While the research is still at a nascent stage, it is promising to see a non-invasive solution to relieve panic effect. The combination of Valium, alcohol, and Myrtus extract can beat the effect of the anxiety heaped by the wait to be diagnosed. Dr. Petr pointed out that "the combination provides relief from adverse anxiety symptoms and, over time, reprograms the brain to avoid creating these reactions," suggesting that long-term use of the triad might help improve resistance to panic attacks.

The study's findings highlight the need for more research to better understand the exact impact of these ingredients in controlling panic attacks. However, the results of the trials give a positive indication of an effective treatment for those struggling with anxiety and panic.
