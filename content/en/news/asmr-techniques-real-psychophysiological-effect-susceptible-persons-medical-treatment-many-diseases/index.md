A groundbreaking study conducted at the [QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute](https://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/) has revealed that [Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR) techniques have a real psychophysiological effect on susceptible persons, opening up new possibilities for the medical treatment of a variety of diseases.

ASMR is a tingling sensation that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine, which can be triggered by various auditory and visual stimuli such as whispering, tapping, and crinkling sounds, as well as gentle touch. ASMR has gained popularity in recent years as a relaxation aid and has even been used by some individuals to help manage symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

The study, led by Dr. Samantha Robertson from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, sought to investigate the physiological effects of ASMR. The researchers recruited a group of individuals who reported experiencing ASMR and a control group that did not. Participants were monitored using [electroencephalography (EEG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) and physiological measures while they listened to ASMR-triggering audio and watched ASMR-inducing videos.

The results were groundbreaking. The study found that individuals who reported experiencing ASMR demonstrated significantly reduced [heart rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate) and increased [skin conductance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity) responses compared to the control group. These findings suggest that ASMR does indeed have a measurable psychophysiological effect on susceptible individuals.

Furthermore, the study also revealed that ASMR was associated with increased activity in key areas of the brain related to emotion regulation and the modulation of homeostatic processes. This provides compelling evidence that ASMR may have a genuine impact on the [autonomic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system) and emotional well-being of susceptible individuals.

These findings have significant implications for the potential medical applications of ASMR. While further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects, the results of this study suggest that ASMR techniques could be harnessed to aid in the treatment of a range of medical conditions, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, and sleep disturbances.

The study's lead researcher, Dr. Robertson, commented on the implications of the findings, stating that 

>ASMR has the potential to be used as a non-invasive, cost-effective, and easily accessible therapeutic tool for a variety of medical conditions. The psychophysiological effects observed in this study pave the way for further exploration of ASMR as a complementary treatment modality.

The potential medical applications of ASMR are particularly exciting given the current state of mental health care and the growing interest in non-pharmacological interventions. If future research continues to support the efficacy of ASMR in managing symptoms of various medical conditions, it could represent a significant breakthrough in the field of mental health treatment.

This study at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute has shed light on the real physiological effects of ASMR, providing a solid foundation for further investigation into its potential therapeutic applications. The findings of this study have the potential to open up new avenues for the treatment of a range of medical conditions, offering hope for improved outcomes and quality of life for those affected.
