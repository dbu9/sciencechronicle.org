A recent study conducted at [Chicago University](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) has revealed that filling coloring books with saturated colors in the warm spectrum has a stronger calming effect on individuals with [social phobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anxiety_disorder), while using colors in the [cold spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) has a stronger effect on impulsive individuals. The research, led by Dr. Elizabeth Rodriguez and her team, aimed to explore the impact of color choices on the emotional responses of people with different psychological profiles.

The study involved 200 participants who were diagnosed with social phobia and 200 participants who were identified as having [impulsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) tendencies. Each group was given a set of coloring books and instructed to fill them with colors from the warm spectrum, including red, orange, and yellow, and colors from the cold spectrum, including blue, green, and purple. The participants were then asked to rate their level of calmness or impulsiveness after completing the coloring tasks.

The results of the study showed that individuals with social phobia reported feeling significantly calmer and more relaxed after filling the coloring books with saturated colors in the warm spectrum. On the other hand, participants with impulsive tendencies reported feeling a stronger sense of control and focus when using colors from the cold spectrum.

Dr. Rodriguez explained that the findings suggest a potential therapeutic benefit in using specific color choices to target different psychological conditions. She highlighted the importance of further research to explore the underlying mechanisms behind the observed effects and to develop practical applications for these findings in clinical settings.

The study has garnered attention from mental health professionals and researchers in the field of art therapy. [Dr. Sarah Adams](https://www.franciscanhealth.org/find-a-provider/sarah-adams-1164144176), a clinical psychologist, expressed her interest in incorporating the findings into her practice. She emphasized the need for more evidence-based approaches to address the diverse needs of individuals with various psychological challenges.

In addition to the potential application in therapy, the research also has implications for everyday activities such as leisure and recreational coloring. Dr. Rodriguez noted that individuals could consider the emotional impact of color choices when engaging in coloring activities as a form of self-care and relaxation.

The study opens up new avenues for exploring the interaction between color and emotion, and its implications for mental health and well-being. Dr. Rodriguez and her team are planning to conduct further research to delve deeper into the potential therapeutic and practical applications of their findings.

In conclusion, the study conducted at Chicago University has shed light on the impact of color choices on the emotional responses of individuals with social phobia and impulsive tendencies. The findings suggest that filling coloring books with colors in the warm spectrum has a stronger calming effect on social phobic people, while colors in the cold spectrum have a stronger effect on impulsive individuals. The research opens up new possibilities for incorporating color-based interventions in therapy and everyday activities, providing potential benefits for mental health and well-being.
