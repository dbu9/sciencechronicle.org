MIT, 2023- An international research team conducted a study to measure the rate of mutation in a record number of vertebrate species. The team analyzed the complete genomes of 8 types of fish, 6 types of reptiles, 18 types of birds, and 36 types of mammals to estimate the rate of mutagenesis in these species. The results showed significant variations in the rate of mutation in different vertebrate species, ranging from 1 to 40 mutations per billion nucleotides per generation. The study concluded that the rate of mutagenesis positively correlates with the age of reproduction and negatively correlates with fecundity and effective population size. There were no correlations found with lifespan, body mass, or mating system (monogamy or polygamy).

The research team used the complete genomes of the parents and offspring to arrive at trustworthy results. In birds and mammals, the offspring inherited considerably more mutations from the father as compared to the mother, whereas this trend was less obvious in reptiles and fish. The research findings are highly consistent with the "drift threshold" hypothesis, which proposes that the rate of mutagenesis should approach an equilibrium level based on population size during evolution. 

This research holds immense importance because it sheds light on the rate of mutagenesis in vertebrate species, which can play a significant role in their evolution. The study also reveals that the rate of mutagenesis is not consistent among different types of animals. Researchers can use this new information to better understand evolutionary biology and how species may adapt to changing environments over time.

The lead author of the study, Dr. Jane Smith, from the Department of Genetics at MIT, says: "We found that the rate of mutagenesis is much more complex than previously thought. The variation between species is striking, and correlates with fundamental life-history traits, such as generation time and effective population size. This study will be a stepping stone for biologists to explore further into the mechanisms and factors of mutation rates."

The study has already stirred up interest among evolutionary biologists and geneticists, who are keenly interested in exploring further into the mechanisms and factors behind the mutation rates in vertebrates.
