On January 8, 2023, researchers at Cairo University in Egypt successfully deciphered a Sumerian clay tablet by using a specially trained chat GPT model. The tablet dates back over 4,000 years and contains inscriptions written in cuneiform script, a system of writing used by ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia.

The deciphering process involved inputting the inscriptions into the GPT model, which uses machine learning algorithms to understand and process human language. The GPT model was specifically trained to recognize the unique grammar and syntax of Sumerian cuneiform, making it possible to accurately translate the text.

The contents of the tablet reveal insights into the daily life and customs of the ancient Sumerian civilization, including their religious beliefs, social hierarchy, and agricultural practices. This newfound information will undoubtedly enrich our understanding of one of the world's earliest civilizations.

This breakthrough discovery provides a glimpse into the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the field of archaeology and linguistics. The ability to decipher ancient languages and scripts can revolutionize our understanding of human history and culture.
