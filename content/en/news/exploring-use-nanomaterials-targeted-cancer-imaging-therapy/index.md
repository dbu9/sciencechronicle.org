Researchers at Peking University in Beijing have been exploring the use of nanomaterials for targeted imaging and therapy of cancer.

The team, led by Professor Jianjun Liu, has been working on developing nanomaterials that can selectively target cancer cells while avoiding healthy tissues. They have been using various materials, such as gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and lipid-based nanoparticles, to deliver imaging and therapeutic agents to cancer cells.

The researchers have been studying the interactions between nanomaterials and cancer cells, as well as the toxicity and biodistribution of the materials in animal models. They have found that some of the materials can penetrate cancer cells, while others can induce apoptosis or cell death.

One of the promising nanomaterials that the team has been working on is gold nanoparticles coated with RGD peptides, which can target cancer cells overexpressing integrins. They have demonstrated in a mouse model that the gold nanoparticles can accumulate in tumors and enhance the contrast of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) images. Moreover, they have shown that the RGD-coated gold nanoparticles can inhibit the growth of tumors and reduce the expression of angiogenic factors, which are essential for tumor growth.

Another type of nanomaterial that the team has been investigating is the use of carbon nanotubes for photothermal therapy of cancer. They have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that carbon nanotubes can absorb near-infrared light and convert it into heat, which can induce cell death in cancer cells. They have also shown that the carbon nanotubes can be functionalized with targeting molecules, such as antibodies or peptides, to selectively destroy cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. This approach has the potential to minimize the side effects of traditional chemoradiotherapy.

In addition, the researchers have been exploring the use of lipid-based nanoparticles for delivering therapeutic agents, such as siRNA or chemotherapy drugs, to cancer cells. They have designed a lipid-based nanoparticle that can specifically target cancer cells with high expression of folate receptors, which are overexpressed in many types of cancer. They have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that the lipid-based nanoparticles can efficiently deliver siRNA or chemotherapy drugs to the cancer cells and inhibit the growth of tumors.

Overall, the use of nanomaterials for targeted cancer imaging and therapy has shown great potential for improving the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The researchers at Peking University are continuing to optimize the design and synthesis of nanomaterials and to investigate their safety and efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies. They hope that their work will contribute to the development of nanomedicine and personalized cancer treatment.
