Medusa, a type of jellyfish, has long been a topic of fascination for scientists and marine biologists. However, recent research conducted at the Akkaba's Oceanography Institute in Jordan has shed new light on the evolutionary ties between medusa and sea urchins. 

Researchers conducted genomic analyses on both medusa and sea urchins and found surprising similarities between the two species. Both organisms share a common ancestor, which existed over 500 million years ago. Although it is not clear how these organisms diverged from a common ancestor, it is likely that they share a number of common features due to their shared evolutionary history. 

Scientists believe that the similarities between medusa and sea urchins may have resulted from the evolution of the two groups in similar marine environments. Both organisms have unique adaptations that enable them to thrive in their particular environments. While medusa are adapted to planktonic life, sea urchins occupy intertidal zones and shallow waters. However, despite their differences in habitat, both organisms require certain features to survive in the sea, such as protective shells and mobility. 

The results of this research have opened up new avenues for studying the evolutionary history of marine organisms. These findings suggest that the most successful species in the sea have a significant overlap in genetic makeup and physical characteristics, despite their stark differences in appearance and habitat. By studying the similarities and differences between medusa and sea urchins, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of how marine ecosystems have evolved over millions of years.
