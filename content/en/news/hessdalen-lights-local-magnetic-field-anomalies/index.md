The Hessdalen Lights can be explained by local magnetic field anomalies, according to a team of researchers at Oslo University. The mysterious lights, which have been observed in the Hessdalen valley in Norway for decades, [have long puzzled scientists]({{< ref  "/news/geomagnetic-anomalies-around-the-world" >}}) and locals alike. However, new research has shed light on the possible cause of the phenomenon.

Using advanced scientific techniques and equipment, the team was able to study the magnetic fields in the Hessdalen valley, and found evidence of anomalies that could explain the lights. The team believes that the unusual magnetic fields are causing plasma to form, which then generates the glowing lights. The research marks a significant breakthrough in understanding this mysterious phenomenon, and could lead to new insights into other similar phenomena around the world.

The research team, led by Professor Anne Grete Hestnes, studied the magnetic fields in the Hessdalen valley for several years. They used a range of scientific techniques, including magnetometers, gravimeters, and GPS receivers, to map the magnetic fields in the area. They also worked closely with local residents and scientists to gather data on the location, frequency, and behavior of the Hessdalen Lights.

>We found that the magnetic fields in the Hessdalen valley are highly unusual. 

said Professor Hestnes. 

> There are places where the magnetic field is much stronger than it should be, and places where it is much weaker. We believe that these anomalies are causing plasma to form, which then generates the glowing lights.
 
The team's findings were recently published in the journal [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/).

The Hessdalen Lights have been observed in the Hessdalen valley since the 1940s. They are described as bright, glowing orbs that appear in the sky, often hovering for long periods of time before disappearing. The lights are usually white or yellow, and can be seen in any weather conditions. They have been the subject of much speculation and debate over the years, with many theories proposed to explain their origin.

Some have suggested that the lights are caused by extraterrestrial activity, while others have proposed more earthly explanations such as ball lightning or electrical discharges. However, none of these explanations has been able to fully account for the behavior of the Hessdalen Lights.

The Oslo University research is not the first attempt to explain the Hessdalen Lights. In the past, various teams of researchers have studied the phenomenon, but none have been able to provide a satisfactory explanation. However, the new research is the most comprehensive and detailed study of the magnetic fields in the Hessdalen valley to date. The team's findings suggest that the Hessdalen Lights may not be as mysterious as they once seemed.

The new research could also have implications beyond the Hessdalen valley. Other areas around the world have reported similar glowing phenomena, and it is possible that local magnetic field anomalies could be responsible in these cases as well. The study of these anomalies could lead to new insights into the behavior of plasma and magnetic fields, and could have applications in fields such as materials science and energy production.

The new research by the team at Oslo University sheds light on the mystery of the Hessdalen Lights. By studying the magnetic fields in the Hessdalen valley, the team was able to identify anomalies that could explain the glowing orbs. The findings could have implications beyond the Hessdalen valley, and could lead to new insights into plasma and magnetic fields. The study marks a significant breakthrough in the understanding of this mysterious phenomenon, and could serve as a model for future studies of similar phenomena around the world.
