Evolutionary biologists have long been intrigued by the mechanisms driving the evolution of genes critical for organismal survival. A new study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution shows that critically important genes seem to evolve faster when their respective proteins interact with other proteins. 

The researchers analyzed genome sequence data from 30 randomly chosen pairs of closely related bacterial species and found that quickly evolving genes were more likely to encode proteins that physically interact with other proteins -- a phenomenon known as compensatory effect of a protein complex. These genes are critical for the survival of the organism, so they are subjected to a selective pressure to stay functional. The authors of the study argue that when the protein interacts with other proteins, it is more likely to gain new beneficial mutations that compensate for any deleterious mutations that might have arisen. This could help explain why some genes evolve faster than others and why genes that are essential for an organism's survival tend to evolve more slowly than others. 

The authors also found that the degree of protein-protein interaction was positively correlated with the rate of gene evolution. Genes that interacted with a larger number of other proteins tended to evolve faster. This suggests that interacting with other proteins can provide a buffer against deleterious mutations and can help genes that are critical for organismal survival to evolve more quickly. 

These findings have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of essential genes and the mechanisms that govern the rate and direction of evolution. This study suggests that understanding the interactions of proteins within the cell and the selective pressures acting on individual genes can help us better understand how organisms evolve and adapt to changing environments.
