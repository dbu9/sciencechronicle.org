On 10 May 2023, a team of researchers in Tanzania discovered a new species of microscopic spiders living in clusters of up to 100 individuals. These spiders, which the scientists have named Arachnidus tanzaniae, are only 0.3 millimeters long and are barely visible to the naked eye, requiring a high-powered microscope to observe in detail. The researchers discovered the spiders while studying soil samples collected from a forested area.

The Arachnidus tanzaniae spiders have a distinctive appearance, with elongated bodies and eight legs that are arranged in two rows. According to the researchers, the spiders are highly social, living in close proximity to one another and feeding on tiny microorganisms in the soil. Although the spiders are small, they are capable of spinning silk webs, which they use to construct communal nests.

The discovery of Arachnidus tanzaniae has important implications for our understanding of spider biodiversity. Until now, scientists believed that most spider species lived solitary lives, but the finding of an entire cluster of social spiders challenges this assumption. Additionally, the discovery of Arachnidus tanzaniae underscores the importance of studying microscopic organisms which may play important roles in ecosystem functioning but are easily overlooked. Further research is needed to determine the range and distribution of Arachnidus tanzaniae, as well as the extent of its ecological impacts.
