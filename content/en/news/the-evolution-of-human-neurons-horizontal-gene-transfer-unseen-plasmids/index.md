Scientists at the University of Tokyo have made an incredible discovery regarding the evolution of human neurons. Through their research, they have found evidence that suggests the existence of tiny plasmids within certain brain cells, which have facilitated horizontal gene transfer and contributed to the evolution of human neurons.

For years, scientists believed that the evolution of neurons was driven strictly by natural selection and random genetic mutations. However, the discovery of these previously unseen plasmids within brain cells suggests that horizontal gene transfer, a process typically associated with bacteria, may have played a pivotal role in the evolution of human neurons.

The scientists used a combination of advanced genetic sequencing techniques and microscopy to analyze the structure of human neurons and search for evidence of the tiny plasmids. The results of their study suggest that these plasmids have been present in human neurons for at least a century, and possibly much longer.

Although the exact mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in human neurons is still being studied, the researchers suggest that it may occur through the exchange of genetic material between cells via small vesicles, or through the direct transfer of genetic material from one cell to another. Regardless of the mechanism, the discovery of horizontal gene transfer in human neurons represents a major paradigm shift in our understanding of neurological evolution.
