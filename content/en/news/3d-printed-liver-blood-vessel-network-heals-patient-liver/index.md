Researchers at Taiwan University have successfully 3D printed and implanted a complex network of liver blood vessels to heal a patient's liver. The team used a combination of 3D printing and tissue engineering to fabricate a biomimetic scaffold that closely mimics the natural structure of liver blood vessels. The scaffold was then populated with the patient's own liver cells to create a functional tissue-engineered liver.

The liver is a highly vascular organ, with a complex network of blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to liver cells. When the liver is damaged, this network can become disrupted, leading to impaired liver function. The team's goal was to create a biomimetic scaffold that could be implanted into the liver to restore the disrupted blood vessels and promote healing.

The researchers began by using medical imaging to create a 3D model of the patient's liver blood vessels. They then used this model to design a scaffold that would replicate the complex network of vessels. The scaffold was fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and electrospinning, a process that creates nanofibers by using an electric current.

The scaffold was then seeded with the patient's liver cells and cultured in the lab for several weeks. During this time, the cells grew and formed new blood vessels within the scaffold, creating a functional tissue-engineered liver. The team then implanted the scaffold into the patient's liver, where it integrated with the surrounding tissue and began to promote healing.

The patient's condition improved significantly after the implantation, with blood tests showing improved liver function and reduced inflammation. The team plans to continue to monitor the patient's progress and to further develop the technology for use in other patients with liver damage.

This study represents a significant step forward in the use of 3D printing and tissue engineering to create functional tissue implants. The ability to fabricate complex networks of blood vessels could have broad implications for the treatment of a range of diseases and injuries.
