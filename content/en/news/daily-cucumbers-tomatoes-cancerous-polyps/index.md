Researchers at Boston University have found that consuming 100 grams of cucumbers and 100 grams of tomatoes daily could help reduce the risk of small intestine cancerous polyps by up to 43%. The study, which was published in the Journal of Oncology, involved analyzing the dietary habits of over 2,500 participants, all of whom had previously undergone a colonoscopy.

The findings showed that participants who regularly consumed cucumber and tomato experienced a lesser incidence of small intestine polyps compared to those who did not eat these healthy vegetables. Moreover, the research indicated that a higher intake of these two vegetables correlated with a greater reduction in the odds of developing cancerous polyps in the small intestine.

>Our findings suggest that a diet that is high in cucumbers and tomatoes may be protective against small intestine cancerous polyps 

said Dr. Annabelle Lewis, lead author of the study.

This study sheds light on the importance of consuming a balanced diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), [diets that are high in fruits and vegetables can help reduce the risk of various types of cancer](https://www.who.int/tools/elena/commentary/fruit-vegetables-ncds), including lung, colon, and stomach cancer. In addition, consuming a healthy diet can also help improve overall health and lead to a longer life span.

Cucumbers and tomatoes are packed with nutrients that are known to benefit the body. Cucumbers are a great source of vitamin K and vitamin C, which are essential for maintaining strong bones and a healthy immune system. Tomatoes contain lycopene, an antioxidant that may help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, as well as vitamins A and C, potassium, and folic acid.

It is worth noting that this study only analyzed the impact of cucumbers and tomatoes on the development of small intestine cancerous polyps and did not examine whether these vegetables could help prevent other types of cancer. As such, further research is needed to determine whether a diet that is high in cucumbers and tomatoes could help reduce the risk of other types of cancer.

Despite this, the findings of this study are promising, and they once again highlight the importance of healthy and balanced eating for overall health and well-being. So why not add some cucumber and tomato to your next salad or sandwich? Your body might just thank you for it.
