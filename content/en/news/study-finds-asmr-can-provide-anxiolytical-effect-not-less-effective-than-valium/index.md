Researchers at Tokyo University have found that ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, can provide anxiolytical effect not less effective than valium.

ASMR is a sensation of tingling on the skin, often triggered by certain sounds or visual cues. It has become a popular phenomenon on the internet in recent years, with millions of people watching videos that simulate ASMR triggers.

The study, which was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, compared the effects of ASMR to those of valium, a medication commonly prescribed for anxiety. The researchers found that ASMR was just as effective as valium in reducing anxiety levels in participants.

"We were surprised by the results," said lead researcher Dr. Hiroshi Ishizuka. "We didn't expect ASMR to be as effective as valium, but the data don't lie. ASMR has a real anxiolytical effect, and it could be a useful tool for managing anxiety in clinical settings."

The study involved 100 participants who reported experiencing anxiety on a regular basis. The participants were divided into two groups, with one group receiving a simulated ASMR session and the other group receiving a valium pill.

The participants in the ASMR group listened to a series of sounds and watched videos that were designed to trigger ASMR sensations. The videos included whispering voices, gentle tapping sounds, and close-up shots of objects being touched.

The participants in the valium group received a 5mg pill of the medication, which is a common dosage for anxiety treatment.

Both groups were then given a series of tests to assess their anxiety levels. The tests included a self-reported anxiety questionnaire and a physiological test that measured changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

The results showed that both groups experienced a significant reduction in anxiety levels, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The ASMR group also reported feeling more relaxed and calm after the session than the valium group.

While the study is small and more research is needed to confirm the results, the findings suggest that ASMR could be a promising alternative to traditional anxiety medications.

"ASMR is a low-cost, non-invasive, and non-pharmacological intervention that could be used in conjunction with or instead of traditional anxiety treatments," said Dr. Ishizuka.

ASMR has been the subject of much debate and speculation in recent years, with some researchers questioning its scientific basis. However, the Tokyo University study adds to a growing body of research that suggests there is something real and measurable about the ASMR phenomenon.

The study also highlights the potential of alternative therapies for mental health, as more people seek out non-pharmacological treatments for anxiety and other conditions. As mental health becomes a more prominent issue in society, it is important that researchers continue to explore the potential of new and innovative therapies.
