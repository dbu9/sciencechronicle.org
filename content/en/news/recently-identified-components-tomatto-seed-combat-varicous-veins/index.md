Recent research at the University of Seoul has identified a number of components within tomato seeds that have the potential to combat varicose veins. Varicose veins are a common problem that can lead to discomfort and even serious complications if left untreated. The condition is caused by weakened vein walls that allow blood to pool and form bulges, typically in the legs and feet.

The research team focused on the potential of tomato seeds, which are often discarded as waste, to provide therapeutic benefits. Their analysis revealed that tomato seeds contain high levels of flavonoids, a group of plant compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the seeds were found to contain significant quantities of vitamins C and K, which are also important for vascular health.

To test the potential benefits of these components, the team carried out experiments with tomato seed extracts on human cells. The findings showed that the extracts were able to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are believed to contribute to varicose veins. The extracts also appeared to enhance the production of collagen, a protein that helps to strengthen the walls of blood vessels.

The researchers caution that further studies are needed to confirm and expand on these results. However, they believe that these findings suggest a potential new avenue for preventing or treating varicose veins. Utilising tomato seeds, which are often considered a waste product in the food industry, could provide a low-cost and sustainable solution to this common and sometimes debilitating condition.
