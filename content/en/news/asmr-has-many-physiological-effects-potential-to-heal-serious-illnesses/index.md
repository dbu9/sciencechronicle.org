Recent research conducted by the University of Cambridge has shown that Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), a tingling sensation often triggered by certain visual or auditory stimuli in susceptible individuals, can have various physiological effects. The study found that ASMR had positive impacts on heart rate, respiration, and neurotransmitters, leading to lower stress levels and improved overall well-being. 

Additionally, the psychosomatic effects of ASMR have been noted, with some individuals reporting relief from chronic pain and even serious illnesses such as depression and anxiety. While further research is necessary to fully understand these effects, the potential for ASMR to aid in healing is promising. 

The study also investigated the individual responses to different ASMR triggers, finding that certain triggers, such as whispering and tapping, were more effective than others. This not only provides insight into the mechanisms behind ASMR, but also suggests potential personalized therapy options. 

ASMR has been a topic of interest for several years, with countless videos on social media platforms designed to induce the sensation. However, this research sheds light on the legitimate physiological effects of ASMR and its potential as a therapy tool.
