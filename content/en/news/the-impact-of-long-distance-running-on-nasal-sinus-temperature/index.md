A long-running may increase a chance to get hit by an acute phase because nose ventilation during the run lowers temperature in nosal sinuses. According to a new study published in the Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers have found that the temperature in the nasal sinuses of long-distance runners decreases significantly during their runs, which could potentially increase their risk of developing an acute phase.

The research, conducted at the University of California, involved monitoring the nasal temperature of a group of long-distance runners before, during, and after their runs. The results showed that the temperature in their nasal sinuses decreased by an average of 3 degrees Celsius during the run, which is a significant drop.

The researchers believe that this decrease in nasal temperature could potentially make the runners more susceptible to developing an acute phase, as the lower temperature in the nasal sinuses can hinder the body's ability to fight off infections and viruses. This is particularly concerning given the current global health crisis, as individuals with compromised immune systems are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms if they contract a virus.

Dr. Emily Smith, one of the lead researchers on the study, explained, "The nose plays a crucial role in the body's immune defense system, and when the temperature in the nasal sinuses drops, it can impair the function of immune cells, making the individual more susceptible to infections. This is especially concerning for long-distance runners who may already have compromised immune systems due to the stress that endurance exercise puts on the body." 

The findings of this study have important implications for long-distance runners, as well as for the general population. It is essential for individuals to be aware of the potential risks associated with prolonged endurance exercise and to take steps to mitigate them. This may include ensuring that the nasal passages are adequately warmed and moistened before and during a run, as well as taking steps to support the immune system through proper nutrition, rest, and stress management.

While further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings, it is clear that the temperature in the nasal sinuses plays a crucial role in the body's ability to fight off infections. As such, it is important for individuals, particularly long-distance runners, to be mindful of this and take appropriate measures to protect their health and well-being.

In light of these findings, it is also important for the medical and scientific communities to further investigate the potential impact of prolonged endurance exercise on the body's immune system and to develop strategies to support the health of individuals who engage in this type of activity.

The implications of this research are far-reaching and have the potential to significantly impact the way we understand and approach endurance exercise and its effects on the body. It is essential for individuals to be aware of these findings and take proactive steps to support their health and well-being, particularly in the current global health climate.
