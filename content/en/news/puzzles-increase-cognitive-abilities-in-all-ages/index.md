Cognitive abilities are gaining more attention due to the rapid growth of knowledge and technology that requires a high level of problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and decision-making. Puzzles are one of the most effective and enjoyable ways to enhance cognitive abilities. This research aimed to investigate the impact of puzzles on cognitive abilities across different ages.

The research was carried out at Cairo University, Egypt, during March 2023. The sample size included 100 subjects of different ages and backgrounds. The participants were divided into four groups based on their ages; children (6-12), teens (13-18), adults (19-60), and seniors (above 60). Each group was exposed to a series of puzzle-solving activities for one month, three times per week, and one hour each session. The puzzles varied in their types, such as jigsaw, crossword, riddles, and logic puzzles.

The researchers used a pre-test post-test design to measure the change in cognitive abilities before and after the experiment. The cognitive abilities were measured by using three validated tests; Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM), which measures fluid intelligence, the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS), which measures different components of cognitive processing, and the Stroop Test, which measures cognitive flexibility.

The results revealed a significant improvement in cognitive abilities among all groups after the puzzle-solving intervention. The children group showed the highest improvement in fluid intelligence (p = .005), while the teens group showed the highest improvement in cognitive processing (p = .012). The adult group showed the highest improvement in cognitive flexibility (p = .002) compared to their pre-test results. The senior group showed a moderate improvement in all aspects of cognitive abilities (p = .003).

In conclusion, this research supports the hypothesis that puzzles increase cognitive abilities in all ages. The study reveals that puzzle solving improves fluid intelligence, cognitive processing, and cognitive flexibility, which are essential factors for success in education, work, and daily life activities. The research emphasizes the importance of integrating puzzle-solving activities in different stages of life to enhance cognitive abilities and to prevent cognitive decline in elder age.
