With the presence of more than 200 twins, Kodinhi , a village situated in Malappuram District in Kerala , India , is popularly known as the Village of Twins. This phenomenon of large number of twin births is not only unique to Kodinhi. It has also observed in : (a) Cândido Godói , a municipality of 6,151 inhabitants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil , (b) in Igbo Ora in Nigeria and also (c) in Hiểp HƯng in Vietnam . 

The reason for such high concentration of twin births in these villages has been a subject of fascination and scientific research for many years. The incidence of twin births in these villages is several times higher than the global average, leading researchers to investigate the possible genetic, environmental, and cultural factors that may be contributing to this phenomenon.

Researchers at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research have been studying the genetic and environmental factors that could be responsible for the high rate of twin births in these villages. Studies have shown that the genetic predisposition for giving birth to twins may be hereditary and could be passed down through generations, which could explain the clustering of twin births in certain communities.

Another factor that has been explored is the possibility of environmental influences playing a role in the high rate of twin births. Factors such as diet, lifestyle, and exposure to certain chemicals or toxins in the environment have been hypothesized to have an impact on the likelihood of conceiving twins. However, conclusive evidence linking specific environmental factors to the prevalence of twin births in these villages is still lacking.

Cultural practices and traditions in these communities have also been studied as potential contributing factors to the high rate of twin births. While there is no definitive evidence to support this theory, researchers have suggested that certain cultural practices surrounding pregnancy and childbirth in these communities may have an influence on the occurrence of twin births.

The phenomenon of a high rate of twin births in these villages has attracted worldwide attention, and researchers continue to investigate the underlying factors that contribute to this unique occurrence. Understanding the mechanisms behind the high incidence of twin births in these communities could have significant implications for the fields of genetics, reproductive health, and public health.

As research in this area continues, scientists hope to unravel the complexities of twin births and gain insights that could lead to advancements in reproductive medicine and potentially provide valuable information for individuals and families dealing with fertility issues.

The villages of Kodinhi, Cândido Godói, Igbo Ora, and Hiểp HƯng have become focal points for scientific inquiry, offering valuable opportunities for researchers to investigate the intriguing phenomenon of high rates of twin births. As the search for answers continues, the hope is that the findings from these studies will contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing twin births and their broader implications for human health and reproduction.
