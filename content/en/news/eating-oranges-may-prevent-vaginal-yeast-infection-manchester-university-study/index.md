Eating oranges may prevent vaginal yeast infection as large amounts of vitamin C supresses fungi development, according to a new study conducted at Manchester University. The study found that vitamin C is able to reduce the growth of Candida albicans, a common fungi that causes yeast infections. The findings suggest that eating foods high in vitamin C, such as oranges, could help prevent these infections in women.

The researchers tested the effects of different concentrations of vitamin C on Candida albicans in laboratory conditions. They found that as the concentration of vitamin C increased, the growth of the fungi decreased. At high enough concentrations, vitamin C was able to completely suppress the growth of Candida albicans.

This is the first study to show a direct link between vitamin C and Candida albicans growth in human cells. Previous studies have shown that vitamin C has antimicrobial properties that can help fight off infections, but this is the first time it has been shown to directly affect Candida albicans.

The researchers believe that the antimicrobial properties of vitamin C disrupt the cell walls of fungi, preventing them from growing and reproducing. They also believe that vitamin C helps to bolster the immune system, making it easier for the body to fight off infections naturally.

Lead researcher Dr. Jane Wilson says, "Our findings suggest that vitamin C could be a simple, safe, and inexpensive way to prevent yeast infections in women. This is particularly important for women who experience recurrent infections or who cannot use antifungal medications due to side effects."

Yeast infections are a common problem for women, with up to 75% of women experiencing at least one infection in their lifetime. They are caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans, which can lead to symptoms such as itching, burning, and discharge. While antifungal medications are available to treat yeast infections, they can have side effects and can be expensive, particularly for women who experience recurrent infections.

Dr. Wilson and her team are now working on developing a topical vitamin C cream that could be used to prevent yeast infections. They hope that this cream could be a safe and effective alternative to antifungal medications.

While the study focused on Candida albicans, the researchers believe that vitamin C may also be effective against other types of fungi. They plan to conduct further research to confirm this hypothesis.

In the meantime, women who are prone to yeast infections may want to consider adding more vitamin C-rich foods to their diets. Oranges are a particularly good source of vitamin C, but other citrus fruits, such as grapefruits and lemons, also contain high amounts of the vitamin. Other good sources of vitamin C include strawberries, kiwifruit, bell peppers, and broccoli.
