Let’s dive into the multifaceted roles orchids play, revealing why they're cherished worldwide not just for their beauty but for their incredible versatility.

🌱 **Environmental Impact** 🌱

Orchids play a crucial role in their ecosystems, promoting biodiversity. They are known for their intricate relationships with pollinators, with some species evolving in very specialized ways to attract specific insects or birds.
