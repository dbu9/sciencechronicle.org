Topical psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects millions worldwide and can significantly reduce a patientâ€™s quality of life. Corticosteroids, such as mometasone furoate, are often used to alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis. However, the use of these medications can have adverse effects, such as skin atrophy and telangiectasia. A recent study conducted in South California, USA, aimed to explore whether hydroxylated mometasone furoate could effectively treat psoriasis while diminishing these adverse effects. 

The study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial that involved 44 patients with mild to moderate psoriasis. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxylated mometasone furoate or mometasone furoate for four weeks. The results of the study showed that both treatments effectively reduced the symptoms of psoriasis. However, the patients who received hydroxylated mometasone furoate had significantly fewer adverse effects, such as skin atrophy and telangiectasia, compared to those who received mometasone furoate. 

The researchers concluded that hydroxylated mometasone furoate could be an effective treatment option for patients with psoriasis, not only because of its therapeutic efficacy but also because it reduces the risk of adverse effects commonly associated with corticosteroids. This study highlights the potential benefits of exploring novel strategies to improve the treatment of topical psoriasis.
