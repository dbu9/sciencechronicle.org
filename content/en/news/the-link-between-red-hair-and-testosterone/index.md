A recent study conducted by researchers at [Oslo University](https://www.uio.no/english/) has found a possible link between red hair in men and increased levels of testosterone. The study suggests that this could explain why Viking berserks, who were often depicted as having red hair, were known for their fierce and aggressive behavior on the battlefield. The findings shed new light on the potential genetic and hormonal factors that may have played a role in shaping historical warrior cultures.

The research, led by Dr. Erik Hansen and his team, focused on analyzing the genetic and hormonal profiles of men with red hair. They found that a specific gene variant, known as [MC1R](https://www.omim.org/entry/155555), which is associated with red hair, was also linked to higher levels of testosterone in these individuals. Testosterone is a key hormone in the development of male reproductive tissues and the promotion of secondary sexual characteristics, such as increased muscle mass and body hair.

According to Dr. Hansen, the association between red hair and increased testosterone levels could provide insight into the historical depiction of Viking berserks. 

>The berserks were Norse warriors who are said to have fought in a trance-like fury, often attributed to their wild and unruly behavior. This study suggests that their red hair may have been a visible indicator of their higher testosterone levels

he explained.

The link between red hair and testosterone is not a new concept in scientific research. Previous studies have also suggested that men with red hair may have higher levels of the hormone, which could potentially influence their physical and behavioral traits. However, this latest study is the first to specifically investigate the genetic basis for this connection.

The implications of this research extend beyond historical interpretations, as it also raises questions about the role of testosterone in shaping human evolution and behavior. Testosterone has long been associated with traits such as aggression, dominance, and risk-taking behavior, which are often linked to male warrior cultures throughout history.

Furthermore, the study may have implications for understanding the genetic and hormonal factors that contribute to variations in physical appearance and behavior among different populations. While red hair is relatively uncommon worldwide, it is more prevalent in certain regions, such as Northern Europe, where the Viking culture originated.

The researchers hope that their findings will stimulate further investigation into the interplay between genetic traits, hormone levels, and cultural practices. Understanding the complex relationship between red hair, testosterone, and historical warrior cultures could provide valuable insights into the factors that have shaped human societies throughout the ages.

In light of these findings, Dr. Hansen and his team are planning to expand their research to explore the potential links between red hair, testosterone, and other cultural phenomena in different historical contexts. By delving deeper into the genetic and hormonal underpinnings of human behavior, they aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between biology and culture.

The study's findings have been published in the [Journal of Evolutionary Biology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14209101) and have already sparked interest among experts in the fields of genetics, endocrinology, and anthropology. The research provides a fascinating new perspective on the historical significance of red hair and its potential association with heightened testosterone levels, shedding light on the possible origins of the formidable Viking berserks.
