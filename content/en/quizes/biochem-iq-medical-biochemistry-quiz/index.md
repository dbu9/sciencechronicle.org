#### 1. A 25-year-old female presents with muscle weakness, hypoglycemia, and increased levels of ketone bodies. She is diagnosed with a deficiency in an enzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation. Which enzyme is most likely deficient?
A. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase  
B. Carnitine acyltransferase I  
C. Citrate synthase  
D. Glucokinase  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ B. Carnitine acyltransferase I
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ Carnitine acyltransferase I is responsible for the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for Œ≤-oxidation. The steps to deduce this involve understanding that:
1. Hypoglycemia indicates a problem with energy production from glucose, leading to increased fatty acid oxidation as an alternative energy source.
2. Muscle weakness and increased ketone bodies suggest impaired fatty acid oxidation, as the body is unable to efficiently use fatty acids for energy, resulting in an accumulation of ketone bodies from incomplete oxidation.
3. Carnitine acyltransferase I deficiency would prevent the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, leading to the symptoms observed. Other options are involved in different metabolic pathways not directly related to the presenting symptoms.

#### 2. A newborn is noted to have a "musty" odor and is diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU). Which of the following dietary components should be restricted?
A. Fructose  
B. Galactose  
C. Phenylalanine  
D. Glucose  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ C. Phenylalanine
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ PKU is caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase, leading to an accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, which are responsible for the "musty" odor. The deductive steps are:
1. Recognizing the metabolic block in phenylalanine hydroxylation to tyrosine, which is essential for its pathophysiology.
2. Understanding that restricting dietary phenylalanine can prevent its accumulation and the subsequent harmful effects.
3. Other options are not directly related to the metabolic defect in PKU.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 3. A patient presents with recurrent kidney stones and is found to have hypercalciuria. Further testing reveals a deficiency in an enzyme involved in vitamin D metabolism. Which enzyme is most likely affected?
A. 1Œ±-Hydroxylase  
B. 25-Hydroxylase  
C. Phenylalanine hydroxylase  
D. Tyrosinase  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ A. 1Œ±-Hydroxylase
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The steps to deduce the correct enzyme involve:
1. Understanding that vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption in the intestines and its deficiency can lead to altered calcium homeostasis.
2. Recognizing that 1Œ±-Hydroxylase converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), which is crucial for calcium absorption.
3. A deficiency in 1Œ±-Hydroxylase would decrease calcitriol production, leading to decreased calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can cause hypercalciuria and kidney stones. Other enzymes listed are involved in different metabolic pathways.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 4. A patient with a history of alcoholism presents with lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia. Which metabolic pathway is primarily affected?
A. Gluconeogenesis  
B. Glycolysis  
C. Ketogenesis  
D. Urea cycle  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ A. Gluconeogenesis
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deductive reasoning here involves:
1. Recognizing that chronic alcohol consumption can lead to an accumulation of NADH in the liver, which shifts the metabolic balance toward the reduction of pyruvate to lactate, contributing to lactic acidosis.
2. Understanding that increased NADH also inhibits gluconeogenesis by reducing the availability of its substrates (such as oxaloacetate

), leading to hypoglycemia.
3. The direct impact of alcohol on these pathways explains the patient's symptoms, distinguishing gluconeogenesis and glycolysis's roles in this context. Ketogenesis and the urea cycle are not directly implicated in the symptoms presented.

#### 5. A child with recurrent episodes of vomiting, lethargy, and hyperammonemia is found to have a deficiency in an enzyme within the urea cycle. Which compound would likely be elevated in this patient's blood?
A. Urea  
B. Arginine  
C. Ornithine  
D. Citrulline  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ D. Citrulline
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The reasoning involves:
1. Recognizing that hyperammonemia suggests a block in the urea cycle, which is essential for ammonia detoxification.
2. Understanding that each enzyme deficiency in the urea cycle leads to the accumulation of specific substrates before the block.
3. A deficiency in ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the most common urea cycle disorder, leads to an accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is converted to citrulline in the presence of ornithine. However, with OTC deficiency, citrulline accumulates due to the inability to proceed to the next step in the cycle. Other compounds listed have different roles and accumulation patterns in the context of urea cycle disorders.

#### 6. A patient diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis exhibits steatorrhea and weight loss. Which of the following nutrients is most likely malabsorbed due to the condition?
A. Carbohydrates  
B. Proteins  
C. Lipids  
D. Water-soluble vitamins  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ C. Lipids
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deduction process involves understanding that:
1. Chronic pancreatitis leads to the pancreas's decreased ability to produce digestive enzymes, including lipase, which is crucial for fat digestion.
2. Lipids require emulsification and enzymatic breakdown to be absorbed, which is impaired in the absence of adequate pancreatic lipase, leading to steatorrhea (the excretion of excess fat in the stool) and malabsorption.
3. While pancreatitis can affect the digestion of other nutrients, the most direct impact is on lipid absorption due to the specific role of pancreatic enzymes in fat digestion, making proteins, carbohydrates, and water-soluble vitamins less likely to be malabsorbed compared to lipids.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 7. A patient with a history of excessive aspirin use is diagnosed with metabolic acidosis. Which of the following compensatory mechanisms is most likely to occur in response to this condition?
A. Increased renal reabsorption of bicarbonate  
B. Decreased respiratory rate to retain CO2  
C. Increased breakdown of fatty acids  
D. Increased renal excretion of hydrogen ions  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ D. Increased renal excretion of hydrogen ions
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The steps to deduce the correct answer include:
1. Understanding that metabolic acidosis involves a decrease in blood pH due to increased acid or decreased bicarbonate.
2. Recognizing that the body compensates for metabolic acidosis by increasing the renal excretion of hydrogen ions to raise blood pH, alongside increasing the reabsorption of bicarbonate.
3. Increased respiratory rate (not decreased) would also be a compensatory mechanism to decrease CO2 levels (an acid), contrary to option B. The breakdown of fatty acids would not directly compensate for metabolic acidosis but could contribute to acid load if ketones are produced in excess.

#### 8. A 40-year-old male with lethargy, depression, and a decreased libido is found to have low testosterone levels. Further testing reveals elevated levels of iron in the liver. Which condition is most likely associated with these findings?
A. Hemochromatosis  
B. Wilson's disease  
C. Addison's disease  
D. Hypothyroidism  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ A. Hemochromatosis
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The reasoning process involves:
1. Recognizing that hemochromatosis is characterized by excessive iron deposition in various organs, including the liver, which can lead to organ damage.
2. Understanding that elevated liver iron levels can disrupt normal hormonal regulation, including testosterone production, leading to symptoms such as lethargy, depression, and decreased libido.
3. While Wilson's disease involves copper accumulation, Addison's disease affects adrenal glands, and hypothyroidism involves thyroid function, these conditions are not typically associated with iron overload, making hemochromatosis the most likely diagnosis given the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 9. A patient with severe abdominal pain is diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). Which of the following substances should be avoided to prevent exacerbation of the condition?
A. Glucose  
B. Alcohol  
C. Vitamin C  
D. Calcium  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ B. Alcohol
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deductive steps include:
1. Understanding that AIP is a disorder of heme synthesis, leading to the accumulation of porphyrin precursors.
2. Recognizing that certain substances, like alcohol, can induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, increasing the demand for heme synthesis and exacerbating the accumulation of toxic precursors.
3. While glucose can actually help decrease porphyrin precursor synthesis by inhibiting hepatic ALA synthase, alcohol consumption can worsen symptoms, making it the substance to avoid. Vitamin C and calcium do not directly influence the exacerbation of AIP symptoms.

#### 10. A newborn is diagnosed with jaundice and a coagulopathy shortly after birth. The infant's mother had an uneventful

 pregnancy and no history of liver disease. Which vitamin is the newborn most likely deficient in?
A. Vitamin A  
B. Vitamin D  
C. Vitamin E  
D. Vitamin K  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ D. Vitamin K
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The reasoning process involves:
1. Recognizing that vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver, which are necessary for proper blood coagulation.
2. Understanding that newborns are at risk for vitamin K deficiency due to low placental transfer of the vitamin, limited stores at birth, and a sterile gut, which cannot synthesize vitamin K.
3. The combination of jaundice (potentially related to the rapid breakdown of red blood cells and liver immaturity) and coagulopathy (due to insufficient clotting factors) points to vitamin K deficiency as the most likely cause. Vitamins A, D, and E deficiencies would not typically present with coagulopathy as an early symptom.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 11. A 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presents with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory tests reveal a deficiency in a coenzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Which of the following is the deficient coenzyme?
A. NAD+  
B. FAD  
C. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)  
D. Coenzyme A  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ C. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deductive steps include:
1. Recognizing the clinical presentation as consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a condition often seen in chronic alcoholics.
2. Understanding that thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for the activity of several enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism, including transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and Œ±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.
3. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is the active coenzyme form of thiamine. Its deficiency disrupts the citric acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway, leading to neurological symptoms. NAD+, FAD, and Coenzyme A are also involved in metabolic pathways but the specific symptoms (confusion, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia) and the association with alcohol abuse point directly to TPP deficiency.

#### 12. A 30-year-old female presents with fatigue, muscle weakness, and hyperpigmentation. Laboratory tests show low sodium, high potassium, and low cortisol levels. Which enzyme is most likely deficient in this patient's condition?
A. 21-hydroxylase  
B. 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  
C. 17Œ±-hydroxylase  
D. Aromatase  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ A. 21-hydroxylase
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The steps to deduce the correct answer involve:
1. Identifying the symptoms and laboratory findings as characteristic of Addison's disease, which involves adrenal insufficiency.
2. Knowing that 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which can present with similar symptoms to Addison's disease in adults, including electrolyte imbalances and low cortisol.
3. 21-hydroxylase is critical for the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. Its deficiency leads to decreased production of these hormones and accumulation of precursors that are diverted to androgen synthesis, explaining the hyperpigmentation (due to ACTH increase) and electrolyte abnormalities. The other enzymes listed are associated with different steroidogenic pathways or conditions.

#### 13. A patient with severe back pain was found to have a vertebral compression fracture. A blood test revealed elevated calcium levels. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for these findings?
A. Osteoporosis  
B. Paget's disease of bone  
C. Primary hyperparathyroidism  
D. Vitamin D toxicity  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ C. Primary hyperparathyroidism
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The reasoning process involves:
1. Recognizing that elevated calcium levels (hypercalcemia) can lead to bone resorption, contributing to fractures and bone pain.
2. Understanding that primary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leads to increased bone resorption, raising blood calcium levels.
3. While osteoporosis and Paget's disease affect bone density and structure, they don't typically cause hypercalcemia. Vitamin D toxicity can elevate calcium levels but is less likely given the presentation of a vertebral compression fracture and severe back pain, which aligns more closely with the systemic effects of primary hyperparathyroidism.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 14. A patient presents with recurrent, severe headaches and episodes of hypertension, sweating, and palpitations. Tests reveal elevated levels of catecholamines in the blood. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pheochromocytoma  
B. Cushing's syndrome  
C. Hyperthyroidism  
D. Acromegaly  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ A. Pheochromocytoma
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The steps to arrive at the correct diagnosis include:
1. Identifying the symptoms and signs as characteristic of a cate

cholamine-secreting tumor, which causes intermittent hypertension, headaches, sweating, and palpitations.
2. Knowing that pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and sometimes dopamine), leading to the observed symptoms.
3. While Cushing's syndrome involves cortisol excess, hyperthyroidism is associated with thyroid hormone excess, and acromegaly with growth hormone excess, none directly cause the acute catecholamine surge seen in pheochromocytoma.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 15. A 4-year-old child presents with intellectual disability, growth retardation, and a musty odor. The child's diet is found to be high in protein. Which of the following dietary changes is most appropriate?
A. Increase carbohydrate intake  
B. Decrease phenylalanine intake  
C. Increase fat intake  
D. Decrease galactose intake  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ B. Decrease phenylalanine intake
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The reasoning process involves:
1. Recognizing the clinical presentation as indicative of phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize phenylalanine due to a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.
2. Understanding that the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the body leads to the symptoms observed, including intellectual disability, growth retardation, and a musty body odor.
3. The appropriate dietary change for managing PKU involves decreasing phenylalanine intake to prevent its accumulation, as opposed to altering carbohydrate, fat, or galactose intake, which would not address the underlying metabolic issue.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 16. A patient presents with numbness and tingling in their hands and feet, combined with fatigue and difficulty walking. Blood tests reveal macrocytic anemia. Which vitamin deficiency is most likely associated with these symptoms?
A. Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)  
B. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)  
C. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid)  
D. Vitamin D  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ B. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deductive reasoning involves:
1. Identifying macrocytic anemia, characterized by enlarged red blood cells, which is commonly associated with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.
2. Recognizing that numbness, tingling (peripheral neuropathy), fatigue, and difficulty walking can be symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency due to its role in myelin formation and neurological function.
3. While vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms, it typically does not cause macrocytic anemia. Vitamin C and D deficiencies present with different clinical pictures, making vitamin B12 the most likely deficiency causing the constellation of symptoms.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 17. A patient diagnosed with renal failure is found to have elevated blood phosphate levels and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Which of the following interventions is most appropriate to manage this condition?
A. Increase dietary phosphate  
B. Administer calcium supplements  
C. Reduce dietary protein  
D. Increase vitamin D intake  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ B. Administer calcium supplements
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deductive process involves:
1. Understanding that renal failure leads to decreased phosphate excretion, resulting in hyperphosphatemia, which can decrease serum calcium levels by precipitating calcium phosphate in tissues.
2. Recognizing that decreased serum calcium levels stimulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism.
3. Administering calcium supplements can help mitigate the hypocalcemia and thus reduce PTH secretion. Increasing dietary phosphate would worsen hyperphosphatemia, reducing dietary protein could indirectly affect phosphate intake but is not the primary intervention for hyperphosphatemia, and increasing vitamin D intake without addressing the calcium and phosphate balance can exacerbate hypercalcemia in the context of vitamin D's role in calcium absorption.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 18. A patient with a history of bariatric surgery presents with night blindness and dry, scaly skin. Which of the following vitamins is the patient most likely deficient in?
A. Vitamin A  
B. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)  
C. Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid)  
D. Vitamin E  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ A. Vitamin A
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The reasoning process involves:
1. Identifying night blindness and xerosis (dry, scaly skin) as symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.
2. Knowing that bariatric surgery, especially procedures that bypass parts of the small intestine, can lead to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A.
3. While vitamins B6, C, and E deficiencies can cause various symptoms, they are not typically associated with night blindness, making vitamin A deficiency the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 19. A patient with a long-standing history of untreated celiac disease presents with bone pain and muscle weakness. Which of the following conditions is most likely contributing to these symptoms?
A. Hypercalcemia  
B. Osteoporosis  
C. Rickets/Osteomalacia  
D. Hyperparathyroidism  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ C. Rickets/Osteomalacia
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deductive steps include:
1. Recognizing that untreated celiac disease leads to malabsorption of nutrients, including vitamin D, due to damage to the small intestine.
2. Understanding that vitamin D deficiency in adults can lead to osteomalacia (softening of the bones), presenting with bone pain and muscle weakness.
3. While osteoporosis involves decreased bone density and can also cause bone pain, rickets (in children) and osteomalacia (in adults) directly result from vitamin D deficiency, making it the most likely cause. Hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism present with different clinical pictures.
{{< /unhide >}}

#### 20. A neonate is found to have a high serum bilirubin

 level but no signs of hemolysis. The baby is alert and feeding well. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the jaundice?
A. Physiological jaundice  
B. Biliary atresia  
C. Neonatal sepsis  
D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency  

{{< unhide buttonText="Answer" >}}
‚úÖ A. Physiological jaundice
{{< /unhide >}}

{{< unhide buttonText="Explanation" >}}
üë©‚Äçüè´ The deductive reasoning involves:
1. Knowing that physiological jaundice is common in neonates, typically appearing between the 2nd and 4th day of life due to the immaturity of the liver's ability to process bilirubin.
2. Recognizing that the absence of hemolysis signs and the neonate's overall well-being (alert and feeding well) are consistent with physiological jaundice, which is usually benign and self-limiting.
3. Biliary atresia, neonatal sepsis, and G6PD deficiency are associated with more severe symptoms and specific clinical findings, making them less likely in a well-appearing neonate with isolated hyperbilirubinemia.
