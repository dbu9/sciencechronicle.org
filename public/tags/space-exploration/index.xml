      <description>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has launched a new study to investigate the impact of artificial gravity on long-duration space travel and human health. The research aims to explore whether artificial gravity can help mitigate the negative effects of prolonged weightlessness on the human body. The study, which is expected to take several years, will involve a range of experiments using both animal and human models. The findings could have significant implications for the future of space travel and the health of astronauts.</description>
