      <description>&amp;ldquo;Modified Urea Cycle in Monkey&amp;rsquo;s Liver Cells which produces Large Amounts of Fumarate and Glycine Surprisingly Reduced Mortality due to Cancer&amp;rdquo;, a research conducted at Tokyo University has shown significant promise in the fight against cancer.
The study aimed at exploring new methods for combating cancer while also attempting to understand the role of the urea cycle, which converts toxic ammonia into urea for excretion. Driven by the previously observed correlation between decreased urea cycle activity and increased tumor growth, the team at Tokyo University developed a modified urea cycle which produced high levels of fumarate and glycine (two amino acids) in monkey liver cells.</description>
