      <description>A long-running may increase a chance to get hit by an acute phase because nose ventilation during the run lowers temperature in nosal sinuses. According to a new study published in the Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers have found that the temperature in the nasal sinuses of long-distance runners decreases significantly during their runs, which could potentially increase their risk of developing an acute phase.
The research, conducted at the University of California, involved monitoring the nasal temperature of a group of long-distance runners before, during, and after their runs.</description>
