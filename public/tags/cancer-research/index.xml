      <description>Aneuploidy, a condition characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes, has long been associated with cancer. It is often observed that cancer cells have an altered chromosome count, with extra or missing copies of chromosomes. This phenomenon, known as aneuploidy, has intrigued scientists for decades, as understanding its role in cancer development could provide crucial insights for prevention and treatment.
The July 2023 issue of Nature magazine features an exciting breakthrough in this field, with researchers suggesting that removing extra chromosomes can potentially prevent cancer.</description>

      <description>Princeton University scientists have recently made a breakthrough by developing innovative nanoswimmers that can travel a long distance inside the human blood stream to find and attack a cancer target in the brain. This innovative approach is expected to bring about a significant reduction in the number of cancer cell deaths that originate from brain tumors.
These nanoswimmers are composed of tiny, self-propelling robots that are only a few microns in size.</description>
