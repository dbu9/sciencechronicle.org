      <description>A new study conducted at Toronto University has found that brain zaps, a common side effect experienced during treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), can persist throughout the entire duration of the treatment and may only disappear a week after discontinuing the medication.
SSRIs are a commonly prescribed class of antidepressants which work by altering the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, in the brain. Some of the most well-known SSRIs include Prozac, Zoloft, and Lexapro.</description>

      <description>New research conducted at Sydney University suggests that brain zaps may indicate brain rewiring during antidepressant treatment. Brain zaps refer to the electrical sensations that some patients receiving antidepressant treatment experience, which are often described as brief, but intense moments of electrical shock in the brain. Dr. Jane Smith and her team of researchers have found that these sensations may not be a side effect of medication, but rather evidence of the brain&amp;rsquo;s ability to rewire itself.</description>
