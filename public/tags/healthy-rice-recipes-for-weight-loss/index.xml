      <description>On December 01, 2024, researchers at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) announced a new method for preparing rice that could be useful for weight loss. The team of scientists has discovered a way to modify the starch composition of rice, making it more resistant to digestion and hence beneficial for weight management.
The traditional method of cooking rice involves boiling it in water until it is fully cooked, resulting in a high glycemic index (GI) food that can cause spikes in blood sugar levels.</description>
