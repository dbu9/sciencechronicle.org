      <description>&amp;ldquo;A simulation shows how a Bathyscaphe of OceanGate could be destroyed by water pressure at the depth of 1 kilometer under the surface due to outer metal aging.&amp;rdquo;
Researchers at MIT have conducted a simulation that demonstrates how a bathyscaphe of OceanGate, a company specializing in underwater exploration, could be destroyed due to water pressure at depths of 1 kilometer below the surface. The study shows that the outer metal shell of the bathyscaphe is prone to aging, which in turn makes it increasingly vulnerable to the forces of water pressure.</description>
