      <description>Researchers at the National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore have made significant advancements in understanding how some heat-resistance Bacillus spores repair their DNA after being heated to 420 Â°C.
The study, published in the Journal of Molecular Biology, provides insights into the mechanisms employed by these spores to recover from extreme heat stress.
Bacillus species are well-known for their ability to form endospores , which are highly resistant to heat and other environmental stresses.</description>
