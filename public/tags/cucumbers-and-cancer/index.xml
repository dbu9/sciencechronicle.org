      <description>Consuming 100g of cucumbers a day could help reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer by 28%, according to a study by Manchester University. The research, which looked at the diets of over 20,000 men, found that those who ate a daily portion of cucumbers were significantly less likely to develop the disease than those who did not.
Cucumbers are already known to be a healthy option for those looking to maintain a healthy weight, thanks to their low calorie and high water content.</description>
