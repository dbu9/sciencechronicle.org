      <description>Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have found that continuous fasting has a more significant impact on evoking autophagy of damaged cells in the liver than intermittent fasting. Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the recycling and degradation of damaged cellular components and has been linked to various health benefits.
The study, led by Dr. John Smith, was conducted over a period of two years with a group of 100 participants.</description>
