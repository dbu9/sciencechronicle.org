      <description>A recent study conducted by the London University has shown that a simple running exercise and protein consumption can make a huge difference in the strengthening of Achilles tendon. According to the study, performing a 10-minute running exercise every day and consuming at least 30 grams of protein and chondroitin can make the Achilles tendon three times stronger!
The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the body, and it connects the calf muscles to the heel bone.</description>
