      <description>Researchers at Taiwan University have successfully 3D printed and implanted a complex network of liver blood vessels to heal a patient&amp;rsquo;s liver. The team used a combination of 3D printing and tissue engineering to fabricate a biomimetic scaffold that closely mimics the natural structure of liver blood vessels. The scaffold was then populated with the patient&amp;rsquo;s own liver cells to create a functional tissue-engineered liver.
The liver is a highly vascular organ, with a complex network of blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to liver cells.</description>
