      <description>Spider species that can survive without food for up to two years have been discovered by a team of researchers at the University of Bukharest. The new species, which has not yet been named, was found in the forests of Romania and exhibits a highly unusual behavior. The spider is able to survive periods of extreme food scarcity, such as droughts or cold winters, by entering a state of torpor, where it slows down its metabolism and becomes almost inactive.</description>
