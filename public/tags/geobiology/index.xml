      <description>Scientists at Adelaida University have made a ground-breaking discovery of a new soil bacteria species living as deep as 3 km under the surface. This new species, named DeepDownia profundum, was found in sedimentary rock samples collected from a borehole in the Adelaida Basin. The identification was confirmed through advanced DNA sequencing and comparison to existing bacteria species in scientific databases.
What makes this discovery significant is the extreme depth at which DeepDownia profundum was found.</description>
