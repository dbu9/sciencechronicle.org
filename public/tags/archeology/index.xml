      <description>Archaeologists at the University of Athens have recently uncovered new evidence in Sparta that suggests anal intercourse was more frequent than vaginal intercourse in Ancient Greece. The findings have caused a stir in the archaeological community, challenging previous beliefs about sexual behavior in Sparta.
The research was carried out at the ancient site of Sparta, where excavations have been ongoing for several years. The team of archaeologists found a number of artifacts that suggest that Spartan society was much more sexually open than previously thought.</description>
