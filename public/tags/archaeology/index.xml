      <description>An ancient civilization located in the territory of contemporary Chad, which lived there 3400 years ago, probably knew how to effectively treat infections, according to a new study led by researchers from Washington University. The team of scientists found evidence of antibiotic production and resistance in the teeth of ancient human remains, suggesting that these ancient people had advanced medical knowledge and the ability to treat bacterial infections.
The research, published in the journal &amp;lsquo;Nature&amp;rsquo;, analyzed dental calculus from 16 individuals who lived in the region during the second millennium BCE.</description>

      <description>El Reyad University in Saudi Arabia, has unveiled the discovery of the oldest realistic plans of archaeological mega-traps for hunting wild animals. The plans, which were engraved on stones, were discovered in south-eastern Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia and date back to around 9,000 years ago making them the oldest of their kind to ever be discovered. These engravings are an extremely precise depiction of neighboring desert kite structures that were dated to the Neolithic era.</description>

      <description>On January 8, 2023, researchers at Cairo University in Egypt successfully deciphered a Sumerian clay tablet by using a specially trained chat GPT model. The tablet dates back over 4,000 years and contains inscriptions written in cuneiform script, a system of writing used by ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia.
The deciphering process involved inputting the inscriptions into the GPT model, which uses machine learning algorithms to understand and process human language. The GPT model was specifically trained to recognize the unique grammar and syntax of Sumerian cuneiform, making it possible to accurately translate the text.</description>
