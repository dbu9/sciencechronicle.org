      <description>Scientists from the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne have developed a new class of medicinal drugs against a wide range of different diseases. The results of the study have been published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology. The scientific work is based on the use of cyclic peptides, which are compounds capable of binding to various target molecules. However, their use as oral drugs is hindered by the fact that they are quickly digested or poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.</description>
