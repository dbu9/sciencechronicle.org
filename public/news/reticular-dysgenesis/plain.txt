# HISTORY

Severe combined immunodefi ciency (SCID) in associa-
tion with congenital aleukocytosis was initially reported in
1959 by De Vaal and Seynhaeve in monozygotic prematurely
born male twins who were noted at birth to completely lack
white blood cells (WBC).
Histomorphologic fi ndings in these infants, who both died
as neonates from septic complications, revealed abnormalities
consistent with SCID, with lack of lymphoid cells in lymphoid
organs and with thymic dysplasia. In addition, bone marrow
contained no myeloid cells and no lymphoid cells, while
erythroid development was normal and megakaryocytes were
present. The authors chose the term “reticular dysgenesis”
(RD) based on the assumption that the disorder resulted from
a defect of primitive multipotent “reticular” cells selectively
failing to develop into myeloid and lymphoid precursor cells.
Subsequently other cases with similar fi ndings were reported,
except that in some, WBCs were not completely absent and in
the marrow, immature myeloid cells up to the promyelocyte
stage were present. An informative case study was published by Roper et al. using
extensive cell-surface marker staining of marrow cells to dissect
the various maturation stages. The authors
found cells of all maturational stages of both lymphoid and
myeloid development in the marrow, with a predominance
of immature cells and almost complete depletion of myeloid
cells beyond the promyelocyte stage, respectively of B cells
beyond the pre-B-cell stage. Interestingly, also a substantial
proportion of mature OKT3-positive T cells were observed
in the marrow. Th ese fi ndings suggested to the authors that
the defect in RD is an undefi ned abnormality interfering with
late lymphoid and myeloid cell diff erentiation rather than an
early stem-cell defect as proposed in the original description
of the disorder. In 1983 the fi rst successful treatment of a
patient with RD by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was
reported, providing evidence that the disease is manifested
within the stem cells and its progeny rather than in bone marrow microenvironmental elements. 
It was also observed that in contrast to patients with
other forms of inherited congenital neutropenias, treatment
with G-CSF in RD was without any eff ect on granulopoi-
esis. More recently, when more patients
became evaluable aft er successful transplantation, primary
sensorineural deafness was recognized as another hallmark
of the disorder. Very recently two groups
independently described the molecular basis of the disorder
to be a defi ciency of adenylate kinase 2.

# CLIN I C A L A N D L A B O R ATO RYP R E S E N TAT I O N

There are a number of unusual clinical aspects that set patients
with RD apart from patients with other forms of SCID:
 
CLINICAL AND LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES IN RETICULAR DYSGENESIS DISTINCT FROM
OTHER VARIANTS OF SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY
• Low birth weight secondary to prematurity and/or intrauterine growth retardation
• Infectious complication during the neonatal period with high fatality rate
• Profound blood leukopenia and agranulocytosis
• Red cells normal/decreased
• Th rombocytes normal/decreased
• Marrow cellularity normal/decreased
• Maturation arrest of myeloid cells in bone marrow


Almost without exception patients come to
medical attention during the neonatal period because of sus-
pected neonatal infection and sepsis, fi ndings of immaturity,
or a combination of both. Th ere is a high incidence of low
birth weight, commonly due to both prematurity and intra-
uterine growth retardation, as based on a review of available
data in 16 RD patients. Birth weights were below 2,500 g in
13 cases and even below 1,500 g in 5 cases. Th is is rather dis-
tinct from patients with other SCID variants, who are usu-
ally delivered at term and appear healthy without evidence
of intrauterine growth retardation. Signifi cant hepatomegaly
and/or splenomegaly was noted in three cases, due in one case
to cholestatic liver disease, in the others of unknown etiol-
ogy. Abdominal symptoms secondary to intestinal stenosis
were observed in two other cases requiring surgical interven-
tion. In all patients surviving aft er transplantation, bilateral
sensorineural deafness became evident (Small et al., 1999).
Hearing assessment by brain stem-evoked response audiom-
etry, applicable already in the small infant, has been useful to
confi rm the diagnosis of RD (Reubsaet et al., 2007 ).
Profound leukocytopenia and agranulocytosis represent
the leading laboratory fi ndings in RD. Automated WBC
counting occasionally indicates a falsely higher leukocyte
count when substantial numbers of nucleated red cell precur-
sors are transiently present in the circulation. An analysis of
hematological fi ndings in 14 recently reported cases where the
diagnosis of RD was confi rmed by molecular analysis defi nes
the range of hematological abnormalities in RD. WBC num-
bers have ranged from less than 100/uL to 1,600/uL (mean
630/uL). Granulocytes most commonly were completely
absent, only exceptionally reaching at maximum 150/uL;
monocytes were usually detected, mostly in lower-than-nor-
mal numbers. Of note, eight patients had neonatal anemia,
with hemoglobin at birth as low as 3.7 g/dL and 5.4 g/dL, and
in the others between 8 and 12 g/dL (normal 13.5 to 19 g/dL).
Five patients showed marked thrombocytopenia, with plate-
let numbers below 50,000/uL in three cases in association
with marked anemia. Th ere was no apparent correlation of
these hematological defi ciencies with septic complications.
Characterization of lymphocytes by surface marker analysis
can reveal the presence of low numbers of CD3-positive T
cells. In one study, six of six analyzed patients with RD were
found to have very low numbers of T cells; in each case, these
cells were noted to originate from an intrauterine maternofetal
transfusion (M ü ller et al., 2001). Th is phenomenon of mater-
nal T-cell engraft ment is also found in other SCID patients
but appears to be rather common in RD. In three of the six
patients with maternal T cells, this engraft ment was clinically
inapparent, while three patients had manifestations of histo-
logically proven graft -versus-host disease, involving in two
cases the skin with mild transitory rashes and in one the liver
with severe cholestatic liver disease at birth.
Examination of bone marrow aspirates and biopsies is
helpful to confi rm the diagnosis of RD; however, obtaining representative marrow samples in newborns, in particular in
premature ones, may be diffi cult technically, and as a con-
sequence adequate morphological assessment not always
feasible. If available, the most prominent abnormality is the
complete absence of mature myeloid cells. Th e marrow usu-
ally is normocellular and is dominated by immature myeloid
cells up to the promyelocyte stage, with normally develop-
ing erythroid cells and with the presence of megakaryo-
cytes.

# M O L E C U L A R B I O L O GY OF RD
Th e defective gene in reticular dysgenesis, adenylate kinase 2
(AK2) , was discovered by homozygosity mapping and candi-
date gene sequencing (Lagresle-Peyrou et al., 2009; Pannicke
et al., 2009).
Th e phylogenetically highly conserved AK2 gene is located
on chromosome 1p35.1 and encompasses about 24 kb. Two
alternatively spliced mRNAs (isoform A and isoform B) are
ubiquitously expressed (except for erythrocytes), albeit dif-
fering in relative expression. Surprisingly, AK2 protein was
detected in the lumen of the capillaries and terminal blood
vessels of the cochlear stria vascularis region in postnatal day
7 mice but not at birth, suggesting that AK2 may function
as an ecto-enzyme (Lagresle-Peyrou et al., 2009). Isoform A
encodes a protein of 239 amino acid length, while isoform B
encodes 232 amino acids. Both isoforms diff er only in a few
residues at the C-terminal end.
AK2 is a nucleus encoded mitochondrial protein and is
located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. AK2
catalyses the reaction AMP + ATP ↔ 2ADP. Th e ADP is
transported into the mitochondrial matrix and serves as the
phosphate acceptor of complex V of the electron transport
chain during oxidative phosphorylation.
AK2 has an ATP and NMP binding domain as well as a
LID domain. Th e extensive movement of its domains during
catalysis has made AK2 a model for molecular dynamic stud-
ies (Schlauderer et al., 1996).
In addition, AK2 has been implicated in a novel apoptotic
pathway through formation of a complex with FADD and
caspase-10 (Lee et al., 2007).

# MU TAT I O N A N A LYS I S O F R D PAT I E N T S 
Pedigree analyses have confi rmed that AK2 defi ciency is an
autosomal recessive genetic syndrome and aff ected children
have failed to inherit normal alleles of the AK2 gene. Th e
genetic alterations are summarized in Table 18.2. Th e muta-
tions are distributed over the complete gene. Th e spectrum
of mutations includes small and large deletions, splice-site
mutations, and missense as well as nonsense mutations. Th e
majority of mutations are homozygously inherited in accor-
dance with the consanguinity of the families. Each family
bears its private mutation(s), excluding a founder eff ect. Th e
mutations did not show any infl uence on AK2 steady-state
RNA levels (Lagresle-Peyrou et al., 2009; Pannicke et al.,
2009).
When tested, all of the identifi ed mutations severely
decrease the stability of the protein. Th e missense mutant
p.Asp165Gly is expressed only in low levels (~10 percent) in
an EBV line but not in fi broblasts of the patient, the missense
mutant p.Arg103Trp shows residual expression (~10 percent)
in fi broblasts, and all other mutants are null mutations.
One individual with all the clinical and cellular character-
istics of RD exhibited no AK2 mutations, suggesting that RD
may be caused by genocopies (Pannicke et al., 2009).
Th e molecular pathophysiology of the AK2 defi ciency is
not clear at present either for the loss of leukocytes or for the
sensorineuronal deafness. Nontransformed primary dermal
fi broblasts of patients exhibit a higher propensity for apop-
tosis with increased reactive-oxygen levels and a lower mito-
chondrial membrane potential (Pannicke et al., 2009).

# Animal models of AK2 deficiency

In zebrafish, one of the human mutations (F3, Table 18.2)
was mimicked by designing a splice-site morpholino. This
led to aberrant splicing of the zebrafish ak2 gene predicted
to result in the translation of a nonfunctional protein.
Interference with Ak2 function did not affect the over-
all development of embryos; likewise, neither immature
hematopoietic cells nor erythropoiesis, as evidenced by
the presence of circulating red blood cells, were affected
in morphants. In contrast, developing lymphocytes (best
revealed by the appearance of T cells in the thymus anlage)
were absent in the Ak2 morphants. This indicates that the
phenotype has a high degree of specificity and that Ak2 has
an evolutionarily conserved function in leukocyte develop-
ment (Pannicke et al., 2009).
Th e eff ects of an Ak2 gene knockout on the phenotype of
Ak2 mutants were examined using P-element technology in
drosophila (Fujisawa et al., 2009). Although homozygous Ak2
mutated embryos developed without any visible defects, their
growth ceased and they died before reaching the third instar
larval stage. Maternally provided AK2 mRNA was detected
in fertilized eggs, and weak AK2 activity was observed in fi rst
and second instar larvae of the homozygous AK2 mutants,
suggesting that maternally provided AK2 is suffi cient for
embryonic development. Disappearance of AK2 activity dur-
ing larval stages resulted in growth arrest and eventual death.
Final conclusions regarding the distinct phenotypes of the
diverse animal models and humans awaits more sophisticated
modeling in mice, most using conditional alleles.

# Treatment

Since the fi rst report in 1983 of successful treatment of RD by
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Levinsky and
Tiedman, 1983), this therapy has been explored in a number of
patients (Antoine et al., 2003; Bertrand et al., 2002; de Santes
et al., 1996; Friedrich et al., 1985; Heltzer et al., 2007; Reubsaet
et al., 2007). Because of the rare availability of HLA-identical
siblings as donors, most patients were transplanted from HLA-
haploidentical family donors or from HLA-matched unrelated
donors. In the initial report, the donor was an HLA-identical
sibling and the patient had received no preparative condition-
ing prior to transplantation. Aft er transplantation signifi cant
graft -versus-host disease developed, complicated by marrow
failure, but subsequently normal hematological and immuno-
logical functions developed, with evidence that all blood cells
were of donor origin. Contrasting to this experience, it became
evident that patients with RD undergoing transplantation in
the absence of myeloablative conditioning are prone to fail
reconstitution of myeloid functions, with persistence of agran-
ulocytosis, presumably because colonization by donor stem
cells requires prior depletion of stem-cell niches in the mar-
row. Although the need for myeloablative conditioning adds
to its risks, HSCT needs to be implemented in RD patients as
soon as possible because of the extremely high risk of the rapid
development of fatal infectious complications. Meanwhile, a
number of patients are long-term survivors, clearly attesting
to the potential of this therapy to permanently reconstitute a
normal blood cell and immune system and to cure the disorder
(Antoine et al., 2003; Heltzer et al., 2007).
