      <description>Lab experiment As usual, we start with an experiment in highly constrolled conditions - in our virtual lab.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first install hydra:
sudo apt install hydra -y Then let&amp;rsquo;s run zabbix appliance to have all zabbix components run in a single command:
docker run --name some-zabbix-appliance -p 80:80 -p 10051:10051 -d zabbix/zabbix-appliance:tag After docker ran, we can see exposed ports:
docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 3b0230770aa0 zabbix/zabbix-appliance &amp;#34;/sbin/tini -- /usr/â€¦&amp;#34; About an hour ago Up About an hour 0.</description>

      <description>Setup We analyzed https://github.com/JPCERTCC/LogonTracer/blob/v1.2.0/docker/Dockerfile to understand how to properly run the docker. We need Neo4j container to be run first, then logontracer container to be linked to. Also, pay attention, without specifying LTHOSTNAME env var logontracer will not run.
docker run -d \ --name neo4j \ -p 7474:7474 \ -p 7687:7687 \ -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \ neo4j:3.2.3 docker run -d \ --name logontracer \ --link neo4j \ -p 8080:8080 \ -e LTHOSTNAME=localhost \ jpcertcc/docker-logontracer:v1.</description>

      <description>The Theory of Post-Imperialism and the Immigration Dilemma Historically, monarchs and imperial powers plundered wealth and resources from colonies in Africa, Asia, and South America. By &amp;ldquo;monarchs,&amp;rdquo; we refer not only to emperors but also to those individuals who amassed substantial fortunes through the exploitation of these colonies.
The nexus between wealth and politics is profound. Those with financial resources have the capability to influence governments, academic institutions, and various organizations by deploying lobbyists.</description>

      <description>In the realm of oncology research, the quest for effective cancer treatments is both critical and complex. The use of tissue cultures, or the in vitro cultivation of cells derived from multicellular organisms, has emerged as a pivotal methodology in studying the efficacy and mechanisms of medications used for treating cancer. This approach has several distinct advantages that make it indispensable in the field of cancer research, offering insights that are often unattainable through in vivo (within the living organism) studies alone.</description>

      <description>The question Recently, on February 16, 2024, Alexei Navalny met his demise within the confines of a Russian prison. On that very day, as per my habitual routine, I found myself perusing the Google Trends page, stumbling upon a curious phenomenon:
Alexei Navalny Well, to be honest, it&amp;rsquo;s not quite a phenomenon, merely a customary spike amidst political turbulence. A crisis equals a spike.
I pondered, Life is indeed peculiar&amp;hellip; This man relinquished everything, including the most precious of commodities - his life - in defiance of an oppressive regime.</description>

      <description>The Last Steak I assure you, my dear, that my decision is thoughtful and sensible. I fully understand the consequences it will entail. I&amp;rsquo;ve done this so many times, all for naught: perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the feeling when the love of all men on our fleeting planet seems so trivial compared to the appetizing sight of a cold cutlet from the fridge. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s been lying there for several days, and for several days I&amp;rsquo;ve made every effort not to touch it.</description>

      <description>A money list instead of a to-do list My job revolves around the internet. I earn my living by working on my laptop from the comfort of my chair. However, I face a significant issue: I get easily distracted by trivial matters such as forums, news, blogs, and instant messaging. I wish to stay informed, yet I struggle to accomplish much. Creating to-do lists doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to help much; their effectiveness wears off in just three days at most.</description>

      <title>Chia seeds vs. Flax seeds: Who wins?</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/article/chia-seed-v-flax-seeds-who-wins/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 22:58:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/article/chia-seed-v-flax-seeds-who-wins/</guid>
      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an ongoing debate online about which seeds are healthier: flax or chia. However, this debate somewhat misses the point, as the concept of &amp;ldquo;healthier&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t one-size-fits-all. For instance, individuals recovering from a marathon and looking to replenish their carbohydrate stores might opt for seeds with a higher calorie content. Conversely, those aiming to lose weight might prefer seeds with fewer calories. Therefore, determining which seed is &amp;ldquo;healthier&amp;rdquo; depends on the intended use of the seeds.</description>

      <description>In the fascinating realm of evolutionary biology, scientists often encounter intriguing puzzles that beckon for a deeper understanding of life&amp;rsquo;s intricate history on Earth. One such puzzle emerges when researchers notice structural similarities between the fossils of a land animal and an aquatic organism, despite clear evidence that these resemblances are not the result of both species adapting to similar environments. This observation raises a compelling question: if not convergent evolution, then what can these structural similarities be attributed to?</description>

      <description>The Evolutionary Path to Eukaryotic Complexity Eukaryotic cells distinguish themselves through a unique structural organization, housing their genetic material within a nucleus encased by a nuclear envelope, a dual-layered membrane that delineates DNA from the cytoplasm. Unlike their prokaryotic counterparts, eukaryotic cells are significantly larger, often by tenfold in linear dimensions and a thousandfold in volume. They feature a sophisticated cytoskeleton composed of protein filaments that interlace the cytoplasm, supporting the cell&amp;rsquo;s structure, determining its shape, and facilitating movement with a network of structural proteins, acting as cellular scaffolds and motors.</description>
