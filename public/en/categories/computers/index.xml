      <description>What are the hardest problems in software engineering? The obvious answer is &amp;ldquo;cache invalidation and variable naming.&amp;rdquo; However, on a more serious note, a significant part of software engineering is devoted to the separation of concerns. This is one of the reasons object-oriented programming (OOP) came into existence. In fact, it could be argued that the entire field of software engineering revolves around the separation of concerns—how to effectively factor and modularize software to make it more manageable.</description>

      <description>For some reason, there is a scare description of how to add and access resources for executables created by nexe-cli. Here we make some clarifications.
What&amp;rsquo;s nexe-cli? nexe-cli is an utility which creates a standalone executable from nodejs code. It compiles nodejs runtime for the target platform and creates a stanalone executable which contains the nodejs runtime and program js source code. Note, however, that nexe does not include node_modules folder in the executable so if the source code uses some of npm modules the distributed executable should be distributed along with the modules:</description>

      <description>Lab experiment As usual, we start with an experiment in highly constrolled conditions - in our virtual lab.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first install hydra:
sudo apt install hydra -y Then let&amp;rsquo;s run zabbix appliance to have all zabbix components run in a single command:
docker run --name some-zabbix-appliance -p 80:80 -p 10051:10051 -d zabbix/zabbix-appliance:tag After docker ran, we can see exposed ports:
docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 3b0230770aa0 zabbix/zabbix-appliance &amp;#34;/sbin/tini -- /usr/…&amp;#34; About an hour ago Up About an hour 0.</description>

      <title>PoC for CVE-2018-16167</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/article/cve-2018-16167/</link>

      <description>Setup We analyzed https://github.com/JPCERTCC/LogonTracer/blob/v1.2.0/docker/Dockerfile to understand how to properly run the docker. We need Neo4j container to be run first, then logontracer container to be linked to. Also, pay attention, without specifying LTHOSTNAME env var logontracer will not run.
docker run -d \ --name neo4j \ -p 7474:7474 \ -p 7687:7687 \ -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \ neo4j:3.2.3 docker run -d \ --name logontracer \ --link neo4j \ -p 8080:8080 \ -e LTHOSTNAME=localhost \ jpcertcc/docker-logontracer:v1.</description>
