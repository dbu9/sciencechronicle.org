      <title>Between the body and the deed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the Possible &amp;ldquo;Physical&amp;rdquo; Nature of Depression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s a strange thing, comrades. Medicine is becoming more advanced, our hospitals are equipped with the latest technology, and medications promise instant recovery. You’d think that by now everyone should be recovering at a rapid pace. But the opposite seems to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are more patients and more diseases. Can you imagine a person who is completely healthy and doesn’t suffer from any illness?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-stop-being-a-horse-and-start-living&#34;&gt;How to Stop Being a &amp;ldquo;Horse&amp;rdquo; and Start Living&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/article/between-the-body-and-the-deed/&#34;&gt;last publication&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;  on the possible &amp;ldquo;physical&amp;rdquo; nature of depression sparked many questions. Despite the variety of these questions, they all boil down to one super-question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What’s the question? Bring it to the studio!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;What should I do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s the question. But before answering it, let me remind you of the content of the previous publication, briefly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The body must eat less (diet, vegetarianism). Sleep less. Rest less. And work more. What does it get in return?! Why should it do everything you demand of it for your sapiens-like goals, which have absolutely no relation to its basic needs?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I overcame depression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience of Self-Healing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since my time in the army, I developed the habit of not treating the flu. Why from the army? Because in the army, they didn’t treat us for the flu. If it was a serious illness, we went to the infirmary (quarantine) or the hospital (treatment). I want to specifically point out that no treatment was provided in the infirmary because there were no medications. The only purpose of being placed in the infirmary was to isolate the patient. Getting into the hospital required a solid reason, like a concussion or self-harm. I don’t remember any cases of concussions in our unit, but self-harm was frequent. Although, it wasn’t real, just simulated. Cut your hand with a razor, and you’d be sent to the hospital and then discharged. A couple of weeks later, you’d come back, pack your things, and go home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intracameral development: manipulative psychological techniques</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/article/intracameral-development/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do not swear off either prison or poverty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many methods that law enforcement agencies use to uncover crimes and understand how and by whom they were committed. However, we will focus solely on psychological techniques that can be used to extract information during a suspect’s time in a cell.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One such technique, or rather a series of techniques, known as &amp;ldquo;operational combination,&amp;rdquo; is intracameral development. The idea behind these methods is that when a person is placed in a prison cell, they are usually in an emotionally depressed state, anxious about their future, actions, and how they ended up in this situation. Law enforcement takes advantage of these circumstances to extract necessary information before the person regains their psychological stability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Do Astrologists and Mediums Gain Fame with Just One Accurate Prediction Among Hundreds?</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-question&#34;&gt;The question&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, on February 16, 2024, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alexei Navalny&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; met his demise within the confines of a Russian prison. On that very day, as per my habitual routine, I found myself perusing the Google Trends page, stumbling upon a curious phenomenon:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;  &lt;thead&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;Alexei Navalny&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/article/how-do-astrologists-and-mediums-gain-fame-with-just-one-accurate-prediction-among-hundreds/nav.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, to be honest, it&amp;rsquo;s not quite a phenomenon, merely a customary spike amidst political turbulence. A crisis equals a spike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I pondered, &lt;em&gt;Life is indeed peculiar&amp;hellip; This man relinquished everything, including the most precious of commodities - his life - in defiance of an oppressive regime. And now, he&amp;rsquo;s but a blip on the Google Trends radar, no longer at the zenith of public interest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The last stake</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-last-steak&#34;&gt;The Last Steak&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assure you, my dear, that my decision is thoughtful and sensible. I fully understand the consequences it will entail. I&amp;rsquo;ve done this so many times, all for naught: perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the feeling when the love of all men on our fleeting planet seems so trivial compared to the appetizing sight of a cold cutlet from the fridge. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s been lying there for several days, and for several days I&amp;rsquo;ve made every effort not to touch it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What to do? Make money!</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/article/what-to-do-make-money/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-money-list-instead-of-a-to-do-list&#34;&gt;A money list instead of a to-do list&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My job revolves around the internet. I earn my living by working on my laptop from the comfort of my chair. However, I face a significant issue: I get easily distracted by trivial matters such as forums, news, blogs, and instant messaging. I wish to stay informed, yet I struggle to accomplish much.&#xA;Creating to-do lists doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to help much; their effectiveness wears off in just three days at most. I can spend weeks dragging out a single task. How can I start to focus my attention without getting sidetracked by the little things? [Richard]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
