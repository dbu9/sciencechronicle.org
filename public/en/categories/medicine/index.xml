      <description>Researchers at the Adelaiada Medical Center have made a groundbreaking discovery that could change the way women approach the treatment of vaginal yeast infections. Contrary to general beliefs, a new study suggests that coffee can be recommended for treating these infections, but with a catch - women must engage in very intensive aerobic exercises while consuming the beverage.
The study, led by Dr. Sophia Rodriguez and her team, focused on the effects of coffee consumption on vaginal yeast infections in relation to aerobic exercise.</description>

      <title>Citalopram-induced Sexual Disorgasmia is an Expected Result of Antidepressant Treatment, Says Manchester University Study</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/citalopram-induced-sexual-disorgasmia-manchester-university-study/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/citalopram-induced-sexual-disorgasmia-manchester-university-study/</guid>
      <description>A new study conducted by researchers at Manchester University has found that citalopram, a drug commonly used to treat depression, can lead to sexual dysfunctions known as disorgasmia. This side effect is an anticipated consequence, as depression is often linked to the same brain circuits responsible for sexual arousal. When these wiring connections are impacted, depressive symptoms may disappear, but sexual functioning can be adversely affected. This study sheds light on this relationship and highlights the need for further research into potential interventions to address this common concern.</description>

      <title>Mannosidosis: Treatment and Management</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/mannosidosis-treatment-and-management/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/mannosidosis-treatment-and-management/</guid>
      <description>Mannosidosis, a rare genetic disorder and metabolic anomaly, arises when the body fails to efficiently break down mannose sugar chains. This inability leads to an accumulation of sugar-laden compounds in various cells, tissues, and even urine, disrupting regular bodily functions and skeletal development.
Description The onset of Mannosidosis is linked to a genetic inability to produce a specific enzyme vital for lysosomes, the cell&amp;rsquo;s structures tasked with breaking down proteins, sugars, and fats, and recycling them into other molecules.</description>

      <description>History In 1959, De Vaal and Seynhaeve first documented a case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) accompanied by congenital absence of white blood cells. This discovery was based on observations of monozygotic twin boys, born prematurely, who had no white blood cells at birth. Post-mortem examination of these infants, who unfortunately died from septic complications as neonates, showed conditions consistent with SCID. This included the absence of lymphoid cells in their lymphoid organs and myeloid cells in their bone marrow, while erythroid cells and megakaryocytes were present.</description>
