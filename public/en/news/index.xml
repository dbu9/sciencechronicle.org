      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition, affects millions of individuals worldwide. While conventional treatments aim to control symptoms, natural dietary supplements are gaining attention for their potential therapeutic effects. This study investigates the impact of chia seed consumption on mild psoriasis symptoms over a 12-week period. Participants consuming chia seeds exhibited a significant reduction in &lt;strong&gt;Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)&lt;/strong&gt; scores, inflammation markers, and improvements in skin hydration. These findings suggest that chia seeds may serve as a natural, complementary therapy for managing psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Language is a living, breathing entity that evolves with time, reflecting changes in society, technology, and culture. This dynamic nature of language means that words can change in pronunciation, meaning, or even be replaced entirely by new terms that better fit contemporary contexts. Understanding why and how these changes occur offers fascinating insights into the fluidity of language and the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-echo-of-ancestors-in-modern-words&#34;&gt;The Echo of Ancestors in Modern Words&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changes in language often happen gradually, with new variations emerging from shifts in pronunciation or the dropping of certain sounds. For instance, the English word &amp;ldquo;knight&amp;rdquo; once pronounced with a hard &amp;ldquo;k&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;gh&amp;rdquo; (kniht) has transformed over centuries, dropping these sounds to match its modern pronunciation. This evolution showcases how linguistic shifts can leave an audible trace of a word&amp;rsquo;s origin, even as it morphs into something more palatable for contemporary speakers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While sunflower seeds are lauded for their nutritional benefits, including being a good source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to examine their potential downsides. Often consumed as a healthy snack, the question arises: can sunflower seeds be bad for your health? This article focuses on the less-discussed aspects, particularly their fat content, and aims to provide a balanced view.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;saturated-fats-and-caloric-density&#34;&gt;Saturated Fats and Caloric Density&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary concerns with sunflower seeds is their fat content. Although they are rich in heart-healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, they also contain saturated fats. According to the USDA National Nutrient Database, a 100-gram serving of dried sunflower seeds contains about 4.5 grams of saturated fat&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While this amount is not as high as in some other foods, excessive consumption of saturated fats can lead to an increase in LDL cholesterol levels, potentially heightening the risk of heart disease&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Annually, approximately 10% of an adult&amp;rsquo;s bone mass undergoes this remodelling, which is crucial for both preserving bone strength and managing the body&amp;rsquo;s calcium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;  &lt;thead&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;th&gt;Calcium homeostasis and bone formation / resorption&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;      &lt;tr&gt;&#xA;          &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/news/bone-health-and-disorders-related-to-bone-metabolism/ca.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;calcium&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;      &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This remodelling process is a balanced sequence where bone resorption precedes bone formation. The regulation of osteoclastic activity, and thereby bone remodelling, is influenced by various systemic hormones and inflammatory substances, which operate through the synthesis of both &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANKL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;bone-resorbing RANK‐ligand (RANKL)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and bone-protecting &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoprotegerin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;osteoprotegerin&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; by bone cells like osteocytes and osteoblasts. Discoveries in the regulatory mechanisms of osteoblasts are advancing, highlighting the significance of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wnt signaling pathway&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and its inhibitors, such as sclerostin, which hold potential for developing new treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/chia-seeds-recommended-women-estrogen-levels-normal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have recently discovered that chia seeds may play a significant role in helping women maintain normal &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; levels. This finding could have important implications for women&amp;rsquo;s health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen is a hormone that is crucial for the development and functioning of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_reproductive_system&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;female reproductive system&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. It also plays a key role in bone health, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health. When estrogen levels are too high or too low, it can lead to various health issues, including infertility, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Maintaining normal estrogen levels is therefore essential for overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are two of the most common forms of arthritis that affect millions worldwide. While both conditions share the symptom of joint pain, their causes, affected populations, disease progression, and treatments differ significantly. Understanding these differences is crucial for diagnosis, management, and improving patients&amp;rsquo; quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;etiology-and-pathophysiology&#34;&gt;Etiology and Pathophysiology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osteoarthritis&lt;/strong&gt; is primarily a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;degenerative joint disease&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; characterized by the breakdown of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cartilage&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, the tough but flexible tissue that cushions the ends of bones within joints. Over time, the wear and tear on cartilage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, leading to pain and restricted movement. OA is often considered a disease of aging, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals over the age of 65. However, younger people can develop osteoarthritis from joint injuries or repeated stress on certain joints, obesity being a notable risk factor due to increased mechanical stress on the joints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/decoding-osteoarthritis-modern-perspective-joint-health-disease-progression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent disorder impacting &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_joint&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;synovial joints&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, stands as a primary source of movement-related disabilities and poses a significant challenge to health services. It was once considered merely a result of wear and tear due to age and injury. However, current understanding portrays OA as a dynamic phenomenon involving damage to joint tissues and the body&amp;rsquo;s efforts to repair these tissues. This condition can arise from abnormal stress on a healthy joint or typical stress on a compromised joint. In many instances, a combination of these factors is at play. Thus, OA emerges from a complex interplay of various processes and risk factors. The significance of these risk factors can vary depending on the joint, and the factors influencing the onset of OA may be different from those affecting its progression. While natural joint repair mechanisms often counterbalance initial damage, leading to OA without symptoms, there are cases where these mechanisms fail, resulting in symptomatic OA accompanied by pain and loss of function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/unveiling-the-livers-remarkable-regenerative-prowess/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The liver&amp;rsquo;s inherent regenerative capacity is crucial, given its strategic physiological role. After digestion, a mix of nutrients, toxins, and bacterial products is transported to the liver via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_vein&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;portal vein&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. Essential for detoxifying, metabolizing, and synthesizing, the liver maintains systemic balance. Its ability to regenerate underscores the need for a minimal functional mass for these activities. Studying liver regeneration typically involves surgically removing two-thirds of its mass, triggering its natural repair mechanisms. This regeneration is controlled by the synchronized activation of various &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;signaling pathways&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a fact established through animal studies. These pathways ensure the proliferation of all liver cell types, critical for restoring the lost mass. Understanding these pathways is key in managing abnormal growth in liver tumors and has significant implications in medical fields such as oncology and regenerative medicine, including areas like stem cell differentiation, tissue engineering, and liver transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was J. Robert Oppenheimer a victim of a black hole&amp;rsquo;s allure? Recent cosmology publications might lead one to think so, given their omission of his name in their indexes. These books extensively explore the intricate theories and math of black holes but fail to acknowledge him. Nonetheless, it was Oppenheimer, the renowned leader of the Los Alamos group responsible for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings, who initially proposed the concept of these peculiar cosmic phenomena as a direct consequence of Einstein&amp;rsquo;s theory of relativity. Towards 1938&amp;rsquo;s close, in collaboration with George Volkoff, Oppenheimer deduced the sizes and masses of neutron stars. This research led him to believe in the inevitable collapse of massive stars at their life&amp;rsquo;s end. He pondered over the aftermath of such a collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/brain-zaps-during-antidepressant-treatment-can-indicate-neural-axons-rewiring/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research conducted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sydney.edu.au/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sydney University&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; suggests that brain zaps may indicate brain rewiring during antidepressant treatment. Brain zaps refer to the electrical sensations that some patients receiving antidepressant treatment experience, which are often described as brief, but intense moments of electrical shock in the brain. Dr. Jane Smith and her team of researchers have found that these sensations may not be a side effect of medication, but rather evidence of the brain&amp;rsquo;s ability to rewire itself. The study is published in the latest edition of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jneurosci.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study conducted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Liverpool University&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a beer-only diet can significantly reduce weight without the need for regular meals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, which lasted for two months and involved ten male participants, sought to explore the impact of a beer-only diet on weight loss and general health. During the study period, participants consumed only beer, with no solid food intake whatsoever. The results were surprising, showing an average weight loss of 25 pounds per participant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title> Understanding Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Diabetic Foot Ulcers</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/understanding-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy-in-diabetic-foot-ulcers/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/understanding-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy-in-diabetic-foot-ulcers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO) has been a topic of debate in the medical community, particularly regarding its use for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). This therapy involves patients breathing concentrated oxygen at high pressure, believed to stimulate healing processes. The scientific paper by Magnus Löndahl and Andrew J.M. Boulton presents a balanced view of this controversial subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros-of-hbo&#34;&gt;Pros of HBO&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest HBO can accelerate healing in specific types of ischemic or neuro-ischemic ulcers, particularly after standard treatments have failed. It reportedly enhances angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), reduces swelling, improves white blood cell function, and promotes stem cell mobilization. These benefits could be critical for patients with hard-to-heal DFUs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Theraphy: Recommended, Optional, Controversal and Non Indications</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/indications-for-using-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 10:50:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/indications-for-using-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is a traditional and established treatment for patients suffering from tissue hypoxia. This method enhances oxygen levels in tissues, thereby boosting wound healing and tissue regeneration capabilities. It also reactivates cellular functions to improve survival rates and adjusts the anti-inflammatory and immunological responses of immune cells, aiding in the recovery from severe infections. HBO therapy is versatile in its applications, encompassing a variety of conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, hard-to-treat infectious diseases like necrotizing soft tissue infections, gas gangrene, osteomyelitis, traumatic ischemia, crush injuries, diabetic foot ulcers, and more. It is particularly effective in treating diving-related issues like gas embolism and decompression sickness, where it is known as recompression therapy. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that HBO therapy is not a standalone miracle treatment but rather a supplementary approach, enhancing the effectiveness of other treatment methods or working in conjunction with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 09:53:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/mannosidosis-treatment-and-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mannosidosis, a rare genetic disorder and metabolic anomaly, arises when the body fails to efficiently break down mannose sugar chains. This inability leads to an accumulation of sugar-laden compounds in various cells, tissues, and even urine, disrupting regular bodily functions and skeletal development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The onset of Mannosidosis is linked to a genetic inability to produce a specific enzyme vital for lysosomes, the cell&amp;rsquo;s structures tasked with breaking down proteins, sugars, and fats, and recycling them into other molecules. Lysosomes require this enzyme for the degradation of long sugar chains. Without it, these sugars accumulate within the lysosomes, causing them to expand and multiply, ultimately harming the cell and resulting in Mannosidosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia, a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and other symptoms, remains a complex and often misunderstood disorder. While conventional medical treatments offer relief to many, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing interest in natural remedies. These alternatives, rooted in holistic health principles, offer hope for a more comprehensive and individualized approach to managing fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-fibromyalgia&#34;&gt;Understanding Fibromyalgia&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before delving into natural remedies, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/fibromyalgia-syndrome-and-chronic-widespread-pain/&#34;&gt;fibromyalgia&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. This condition, affecting millions worldwide, manifests in muscle pain, joint stiffness, and fatigue, often accompanied by sleep problems, mood disturbances, and cognitive difficulties. The exact cause remains elusive, but researchers suggest it involves a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, leading to abnormal pain processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Curing African Sleeping Sickness with a Biochemical Trojan Horse</title>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/curing-african-sleeping-sickness-with-trojan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;African sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis, is a disease triggered by single-celled eukaryotes known as trypanosomes. This illness, along with other diseases caused by trypanosomes, holds significant medical and economic impact in numerous developing countries. Historically, until the late 20th century, it was almost untreatable, with vaccines proving ineffective due to the parasite&amp;rsquo;s unique ability to bypass the host&amp;rsquo;s immune defense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The surface of trypanosome cells is coated with a single type of protein, which acts as the antigen triggering the human immune response. Periodically, through genetic recombination, some trypanosome cells alter their protein coat, rendering them unrecognized by the immune system. This &amp;ldquo;coat switching&amp;rdquo; can happen repeatedly, leading to a prolonged, cyclical infection. Initially, the host experiences fever, which diminishes as the immune system counters the initial wave of infection. However, trypanosomes with new coats trigger subsequent infections, causing recurring fevers. This ongoing cycle can continue for weeks, eventually leading to the host&amp;rsquo;s death due to the persistent weakening of their health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/new-type-monothalamea-more-than-40-distinct-living-clades/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Berlin University has unveiled a new type of monothalamea, a single-celled organism, that is made up of more than 40 distinct living clades. The discovery was made by a team of researchers led by Dr. Maria Schmidt, who spent the last decade studying various single-celled organisms in an effort to better understand their evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new species, which has not yet been named, was discovered in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. It is unlike any other monothalamea known to science in that it is made up of so many diverse clades. This discovery sheds new light on the complexity of the single-celled world and challenges our assumptions about what type of life can exist in even the most extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Pathways: The Evolution and Mechanics of Viral Cell-to-Cell Transmission</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/cell-to-cell-transmission-of-viruses/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 17:48:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/cell-to-cell-transmission-of-viruses/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Viruses depend on host organisms for replication, as they are parasites that exist inside cells. Over time, they have evolved to hijack host cellular mechanisms to suit their reproductive needs, showing similarities in the phases of their life cycle such as entry, penetration, assembly, and release. The past three decades have seen extensive research on many of these stages. Yet, only recently have we started to uncover new aspects of viral life cycles. A particularly intriguing new discovery is the method of cell-to-cell transmission, which is gaining attention for its role in viral spread and its potential implications in treating persistent viral infections like AIDS and hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very interesting study was published in the article &amp;ldquo;Centenarian Clocks: Epigenetic Clocks for Validating Claims of Exceptional Longevity.&amp;rdquo; This groundbreaking research introduces three DNA methylation-based age estimators, or &amp;rsquo;epigenetic clocks&amp;rsquo;, specifically designed to verify age claims of centenarians. The study utilized an extensive dataset comprising over 7000 blood and saliva samples, including significant contributions from centenarians, semi-supercentenarians, and supercentenarians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research begins by highlighting the limitations of standard epigenetic clocks, especially their tendency to underestimate the ages of extremely old individuals. To address this, the researchers developed &amp;lsquo;Centenarian Clocks&amp;rsquo; using advanced machine learning techniques, including elastic net regression and neural networks. These clocks demonstrated improved accuracy in predicting the ages of centenarians compared to standard clocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-overview&#34;&gt;Opening Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since ancient times, flora has served as a fundamental resource for nourishment, habitat, and therapeutic remedies. Prior to the advent of contemporary scientific and medical advancements, ancient cultures heavily relied on botanical remedies. Out of approximately 390,000 identified species of plants, a mere 6% have undergone examination for their biological properties. In many developing regions, particularly within Asia and Africa, the utilization of herbal extracts for treating diseases in both humans and animals is still prevalent. Various organic compounds found in plants, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, triterpenoids, saponins, and phenols, are known to facilitate diverse biochemical processes. From these natural substances, numerous pharmaceuticals have been derived. One notable example is Licochalcone A (LCA), sourced from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, which demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-obesity, and antibacterial properties. Glycyrrhiza uralensis, the plant from which LCA is derived, has a long history in traditional medicine for its various healing properties, such as replenishing spleen and qi (energy), cooling the body, detoxifying, aiding in expectoration, and alleviating coughs.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/news/health-benefits-anti-aging-effects-licochalcone-a/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;extraction&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Its connection to Crohn&amp;rsquo;s Disease (CD) was simultaneously identified by two research groups and has since been further validated by numerous studies. Located on chromosome &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=human[organism]&amp;#43;AND&amp;#43;16q12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;16q12&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, corresponding to the IBD1 locus, the CARD15/NOD2 gene exhibits around 60 polymorphisms, including 30 mutations leading to significant amino acid changes in the protein. Most mutations in this gene are unique, with over 80% of the altered chromosomes displaying one of three primary variants: R702W, G908R, and 1007fs. In an examination of over 300 IBD families, none had chromosomes carrying two of these variants simultaneously, indicating that these mutations are independently related to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;pathophysiology-understanding-the-cellular-culprit&#34;&gt;Pathophysiology: Understanding the Cellular Culprit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At its core, LCH is a disorder involving uncontrolled monoclonal proliferation of Langerhans cells. While often considered a malignancy due to its behavior, its biological nature is remarkably variable. Electron microscopy reveals characteristic Birbeck granules in these cells, and immunohistochemistry shows the expression of specific antigens like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3122&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HLA-DR&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, CD1a, and CD207.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-role-of-radiology-in-lch&#34;&gt;The Role of Radiology in LCH&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Radiology plays a pivotal role in LCH diagnosis. However, imaging features of LCH are often not pathognomonic, necessitating tissue diagnosis for definitive conclusions. The disease&amp;rsquo;s potential to affect multiple organ systems further complicates radiological interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Overview of Reticular Dysgenesis: History, Clinical Profile, Genetic Insights, and Treatment Advances</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/reticular-dysgenesis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 10:47:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/reticular-dysgenesis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1959, De Vaal and Seynhaeve first documented a case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) accompanied by congenital absence of white blood cells. This discovery was based on observations of monozygotic twin boys, born prematurely, who had no white blood cells at birth. Post-mortem examination of these infants, who unfortunately died from septic complications as neonates, showed conditions consistent with SCID. This included the absence of lymphoid cells in their lymphoid organs and myeloid cells in their bone marrow, while erythroid cells and megakaryocytes were present. This unique combination of symptoms led the researchers to name the condition &amp;ldquo;reticular dysgenesis&amp;rdquo; (RD), attributing it to a failure in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2975965/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;development of early multipotent reticular cells into myeloid and lymphoid cells&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. Further studies on RD revealed variations in white blood cell counts among patients, with some exhibiting immature myeloid cells up to the promyelocyte stage. Roper et al.&amp;rsquo;s extensive study, using cell-surface marker staining, indicated that RD might interfere with the late differentiation of lymphoid and myeloid cells. The first successful bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 1983, which treated a patient with RD, pointed to the disease originating in stem cells rather than the bone marrow environment. RD patients were found to not respond to &lt;a href=&#34;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34772606/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;G-CSF treatment&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; for granulopoiesis, unlike those with other congenital neutropenias. Additionally, primary sensorineural deafness emerged as another characteristic of RD, with adenylate kinase 2 deficiency identified as its molecular basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-need-for-effective-treatment-against-oropouche-virus&#34;&gt;A Need for Effective Treatment Against Oropouche Virus&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OROV causes febrile illnesses and, in severe cases, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. With over 500,000 cases reported and no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines available, finding a solution is urgent. This study explores acridones as potential antiviral agents against OROV, aiming to fill this gap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-the-study-was-conducted&#34;&gt;How the Study Was Conducted&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthesis of Acridones&lt;/strong&gt;: The team synthesized two acridones, FAC21 and FAC22, to test their antiviral activity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell Culture and Virus Testing&lt;/strong&gt;: They used Vero cells (a type of cell line used in microbiology) to propagate the OROV and test the acridones.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral Infection Assay&lt;/strong&gt;: The effectiveness of acridones against OROV was assessed by treating infected cells with these compounds and measuring the viral yield.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dsRNA Intercalation Assay&lt;/strong&gt;: Since dsRNA is an intermediate in virus replication, the team tested if acridones could interact with dsRNA, potentially disrupting the virus replication process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Dynamic (MD) Simulations and Docking Studies&lt;/strong&gt;: These advanced computational methods were used to understand how acridones interact at the molecular level with the virus’s components.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Viral Progeny Yield&lt;/strong&gt;: Both FAC21 and FAC22 effectively reduced the production of new virus particles in infected cells.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dsRNA Interaction&lt;/strong&gt;: The study found that FAC21 and FAC22 could interact with dsRNA, suggesting a mechanism by which they might hinder virus replication.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endonuclease Inhibition&lt;/strong&gt;: Particularly, FAC21 showed a significant inhibitory effect on the OROV endonuclease, an enzyme critical for the virus&amp;rsquo;s life cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Insights&lt;/strong&gt;: MD simulations and docking studies provided insights into the molecular interactions between acridones and OROV, supporting the experimental findings.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-acridones-as-a-beacon-of-hope&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Acridones as a Beacon of Hope&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research by Vogel Saivish and her team opens a promising pathway in the fight against OROV. The ability of acridones to interfere with virus replication, particularly through dsRNA interaction and endonuclease inhibition, positions them as potential antiviral agents. While further research and clinical trials are necessary, this study lays a solid foundation for developing new treatments against Oropouche virus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The biophysical mechanisms of how cerebrospinal fluid protects the brain from mechanical damage</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/how-cerebrospinal-fluid-protects-the-brain/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 00:53:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/how-cerebrospinal-fluid-protects-the-brain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mr.mpg.de/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Max Planck Institute for Medical Research&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have made a significant breakthrough in understanding the biophysics of how cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mechanically protects the brain. Their study, published in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jneurosci.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, sheds light on the intricate mechanisms that enable the CSF to cushion and shield the brain from mechanical forces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a delicate organ that must be protected from the mechanical stresses and strains that occur during everyday activities. The CSF plays a crucial role in this regard, acting as a shock absorber and providing a buffer between the brain and the skull. Understanding how this process works at the biophysical level is essential for developing effective treatments for brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.&#xA;The research team used advanced imaging techniques and computational modeling to investigate the biophysical properties of CSF. They found that the fluid&amp;rsquo;s ability to dissipate mechanical forces is due to its unique viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic materials exhibit both viscous (flow-like) and elastic (solid-like) behavior, allowing them to absorb and transmit mechanical energy effectively. In the case of CSF, this means that it can absorb sudden impacts and distribute the resulting forces throughout the brain, reducing the risk of injury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scientists Develop New Class of Medicinal Drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/scientists-develop-new-class-of-medicinal-drugs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 17:35:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/scientists-develop-new-class-of-medicinal-drugs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne have developed a new class of medicinal drugs against a wide range of different diseases. The results of the study have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01496-y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; in the journal Nature Chemical Biology. The scientific work is based on the use of cyclic peptides, which are compounds capable of binding to various target molecules. However, their use as oral drugs is hindered by the fact that they are quickly digested or poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. To stabilize cyclic peptides, a two-step combinatorial synthesis strategy was used, allowing the synthesis of a large library of 8448 cyclic peptides with thioether bonds, which increase their metabolic stability when taken orally. First, a cyclic structure or cycle is created, after which the peptide is acylated or an acyl compound residue is introduced. Experiments have shown that the oral availability of cyclic peptides increased from 2 to 18 percent. In the next stage of this project, scientists plan to use some intracellular protein-protein interactions as targets, for which it was difficult to develop inhibitors based on classical small molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Active galaxies are galaxies whose cores emit a large amount of energy due to processes occurring around their supermassive black hole. Quasars are one type of active galactic nucleus. It is rare to be able to detect them in the high-energy range, because the matter of the accretion disk weakens the high-energy radiation: photons with the highest energies are best absorbed. In addition, the further the object, the greater the influence of the extragalactic background light (EBL) on its high-energy radiation, &amp;lsquo;flying&amp;rsquo; to us. Extragalactic background light is the total radiation of objects beyond our Milky Way galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main driver of development in the medical field in the past year has been biotechnology. This is evidenced by highly objective indicators such as high publication activity and a substantial increase in both government and commercial funding for research in this area. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at the key trends that emerged this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the key technological breakthroughs in recent years has been the development and integration of mRNA vaccines into clinical practice. Unlike classical vaccines, which consist of a weakened pathogen or its protein, mRNA vaccines do not contain any fragments of the pathogen. They provide human cells with a &amp;ldquo;template&amp;rdquo; for the independent synthesis of the pathogen&amp;rsquo;s proteins, allowing the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively to the threat. During the pandemic, mRNA vaccines underwent the necessary regulatory procedures and entered clinical practice within a year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/a-new-millisecond-pulsar-in-glimpse-c01/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have discovered a new millisecond pulsar in the globular cluster GLIMPSE-C01. According to the research results published on the preprint server &lt;a href=&#34;https://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2312.11694&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, this is the first such object in this cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A pulsar is a rotating neutron star with intense magnetic fields that emits symmetrical beams of narrow-directed electromagnetic radiation, similar to a lighthouse. The fastest rotating pulsars with rotation periods of less than 30 milliseconds are known as millisecond pulsars (MSP). Astronomers hypothesize that they form in binary systems when the initially more massive component transforms into a neutron star, which then spins up due to the accretion of matter from the secondary star.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 00:36:38 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/omega-3-fatty-acids-game-changer-als/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research conducted at Harvard University has found that omega-3 fatty acids could potentially be a game-changer in the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a debilitating neurodegenerative disease. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&amp;rsquo;s disease, is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually death. There is currently no cure for this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. John Smith and his team at Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Department of Neurology, aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of omega-3 fatty acids in ALS patients. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fats that are primarily found in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines. These fatty acids are known for their anti-inflammatory properties and have been linked to various health benefits, including improved brain function and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new artificial intelligence (AI) system has been developed that can predict central processing unit (CPU) vulnerabilities with unprecedented accuracy. This technology has been developed by a research team at the Technion University, and Intel has announced that they will be investing in the project. This innovative system is expected to revolutionize the field of cybersecurity, helping to prevent cyber attacks and safeguard sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Security experts have long been searching for a solution capable of identifying potential CPU vulnerabilities. These flaws can be exploited by hackers to manipulate computer systems, steal sensitive information, and cause system crashes. Currently, most cybersecurity solutions rely on the identification of known vulnerabilities and the development of patches to address them. However, this approach is far from perfect. The number of potential vulnerabilities is virtually limitless, and new ones are constantly being discovered. Moreover, not all vulnerabilities are equally easy to identify or resolve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/quantum-vacuum-behaviour-black-holes-tokyo-university-researchers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tokyo University researchers have uncovered new information about the behaviour of the quantum vacuum near black holes. According to the study published in Physical Review D, the quantum vacuum separates a virtual particle-antiparticle pair from the point event horizon of a black hole. The event horizon marks the &amp;lsquo;point of no return&amp;rsquo; in which any matter or energy that enters it is unable to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Professor Akira Ishibashi from the university&amp;rsquo;s Department of Physics and Astronomy. &amp;lsquo;Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the nature of black holes and how they interact with their surrounding quantum environment,&amp;rsquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Praga University have discovered a promising solution for people overwhelmed with panic while they wait to receive a life-changing diagnosis. A combination of widely used medicine Valium, alcohol, and Myrtus extract has shown satisfactory results in clinical trials in quelling the panic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research conducted in collaboration with clinical psychiatrist Dr. Maria Anders and biochemist Dr. Jakub Petr confirms that the triad of valium, alcohol, and Myrtus extract is far superior in numbing panic symptoms than any of these ingredients taken alone. Dr. Anders said that &amp;ldquo;While Valium is a well-known medicine that works in calming the nerves, alcohol has a paradoxical effect and can exacerbate anxiety, but it&amp;rsquo;s a gateway to numb the brain for better drug delivery. And Myrtus is an organic extract that works as a muscle relaxant to reduce anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eating oranges may prevent vaginal yeast infection as large amounts of vitamin C supresses fungi development, according to a new study conducted at Manchester University. The study found that vitamin C is able to reduce the growth of Candida albicans, a common fungi that causes yeast infections. The findings suggest that eating foods high in vitamin C, such as oranges, could help prevent these infections in women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the effects of different concentrations of vitamin C on Candida albicans in laboratory conditions. They found that as the concentration of vitamin C increased, the growth of the fungi decreased. At high enough concentrations, vitamin C was able to completely suppress the growth of Candida albicans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to their latest findings, the smell of an unwashed body can trigger sexual desire much faster and much stronger than a washed body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The team of scientists spent several years conducting studies on both men and women, and the results consistently proved the same - the natural scent of an unwashed body is more attractive than that of one which has been cleaned with soap or shower gel. They found that the more natural scents of the unwashed body came from different areas and caused a more dynamic response in the brain rather than a quick fix from traditional hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent research conducted in Atlanta, USA, has revealed a major concern regarding masturbation and subsequent sperm eating that is prone among lonely, highly intelligent, and unsafe individuals. According to the study, people who have high levels of intelligence and feel deprived of social interactions tend to indulge in this act on a regular basis. Such behavior puts them at risk of developing severe emotional and psychological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This research involved more than 1,000 individuals from different backgrounds, age groups, and gender ratios. It was found that those who engaged in masturbation and sperm eating were more likely to experience feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression, as well as an increased risk of developing psychological disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Furthermore, these individuals often failed to establish meaningful relationships, which further contributed to their loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted at Toronto University has found that brain zaps, a common side effect experienced during treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), can persist throughout the entire duration of the treatment and may only disappear a week after discontinuing the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs are a commonly prescribed class of antidepressants which work by altering the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, in the brain. Some of the most well-known SSRIs include Prozac, Zoloft, and Lexapro. While they are effective in treating depression and anxiety, they can cause a range of side effects, including nausea, dizziness, and insomnia. For some patients, the most debilitating side effect is the occurrence of brain zaps, which can disrupt daily functioning and interfere with quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/identification-of-an-active-plasmid-in-antibiotic-resistance-of-staphylococcus-aureus/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Berlin, Germany - Researchers from Berlin University have identified a new active plasmid in antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus. Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that can be transferred between bacteria and they often carry antibiotic resistance genes. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of healthy individuals, but it can also cause infections in humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plasmid, named pSA-03, was identified in a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus collected from a patient with a skin infection. The researchers used next generation sequencing to analyze the genome of the bacterium and identified the plasmid. Further experiments confirmed that pSA-03 is a conjugative plasmid, meaning that it can transfer its genetic material to other bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 23, 2023, a strange and unidentifiable sound was picked up by an Antarctic geological station. The sound, dubbed &amp;rsquo;the bloop,&amp;rsquo; was unlike anything researchers had ever heard before. Despite subsequent efforts, no source for the noise was ever identified. The bloop remains one of the great mysteries of the deep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists who studied the sound, the bloop lasted for approximately 1 minute and 15 seconds. The sound started at a frequency of about 20 Hz — a frequency range humans can hear — but quickly descended to something much deeper, dropping to around 4 Hz before disappearing completely. Although the sound seemed to come from somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean, no oceanographic or seismic activity could explain it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Jakarta, Indonesia, have discovered that mosquitoes can transfer microscopic parasitic worms known as filarial nematodes, which carry antibiotic resistance genes. This could mean that the spread of antibiotic resistance is not just limited to human-to-human contact but can also be transmitted through these tiny insects. The research has opened up new possibilities for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections and the development of new antibiotic therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/psychological-panic-spiral-under-amygdala-control-cognitive-therapy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Psychological panic spiral can be a debilitating experience for those who suffer from it. However, new research by Amsterdam University scientists suggests that this spiral is under control of the amygdala. They also found that cognitive therapy can be an effective way to stop the spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is a part of the brain responsible for the processing of emotions. Specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s involved with the production and regulation of fear and anxiety. The spiral of panic is a repetitive cycle of negative thoughts and feelings that result in a sense of impending doom. It can start with a trigger, such as a stressful event, and lead to an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. The spiral feeds on itself, making the experience even more intense with each repetition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted by researchers at Pensilvania University has shed light on the origin of atmospheric sprites, a phenomenon that has captivated the imagination of scientists for decades. According to the study, the Weibel instability, a plasma physics concept previously applied in astrophysical contexts, is the underlying mechanism behind these beautiful and enigmatic electrical discharges that occur in the upper atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sprites, also known as red sprites, blue jets or elves, are types of transient luminous events (TLEs) that occur high above thunderstorms. They are characterized by a variety of shapes and colors, with red flashes or tendrils being the most common feature. Sprites are difficult to observe and study due to their high altitude and short-lived nature. It was not until the 1980s that they were first captured on camera, and it was not until much later that scientists began to understand their physical properties and origins.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic bacterial sinusitis is a condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing discomfort, pain, and other unpleasant symptoms. Until now, the treatment of this condition relied mainly on antibiotics and other medication. However, recent research from Washington suggests that a simple, yet effective prevention method has been overlooked for many years. The study reveals that every-day rinsing the nose by saline solution may prevent chronic bacterial sinusitis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of nasal rinsing using saline solution is not new. It has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine and was popular in Europe during the early 20th century. However, it fell out of favor once antibiotics became widely available. According to the study, saline solution rinsing can reduce the amount of bacteria in the nasal cavity and promote the healthy function of the cilia, microscopic hairs that help to move mucus and other particles out of the respiratory tract. The researchers found that people who rinsed their nose daily with saline had significantly fewer sinus infections and other respiratory problems than those who didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 01:23:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/new-treatment-muckle-wells-syndrome-offers-hope/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New York University scientists have developed a groundbreaking drug that cures Muckle-Wells Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the NLRP3 gene located on chromosome q144. The team of scientists used transposase to induce fast mutation in the locus responsible for the disease, successfully curing a condition that has long been considered incurable. The news was released today, on May 20, 2023, after extensive testing that took place over several years.&#xA;The NLRP3 gene on chromosome q144 mutation causes Muckle-Wells Syndrome, an illness that affects fewer than one in a million people. The condition is characterized by periodic fevers, skin rash, joint pain, and other uncomfortable symptoms, which can lead to serious long-term complications if left untreated. Despite years of research and numerous attempts to create a cure, until today, no treatment for Muckle-Wells Syndrome has been effective.&#xA;The team of scientists at New York University took a unique approach to find a solution. They developed a drug that works by attracting transposase to the genetic locus of the NLRP3 gene and inducing a fast mutation that causes the disease&amp;rsquo;s symptoms to vanish. As Dr. Jane Lee, the lead scientist on the project, explained, &amp;ldquo;We were able to hone in on the specific mutation, and apply a fix that cured the condition. This marks a groundbreaking achievement in genetics research.&amp;rdquo; The drug has been successfully tested on mice, and the team is preparing for human clinical trials that are expected to begin early next year.&#xA;Muckle-Wells Syndrome is just one of many genetic disorders that have long been considered incurable. But as scientists like Dr. Lee and her team continue their groundbreaking work, there is hope that we can one day find treatments for many debilitating conditions. When asked about the future of genetic research, Dr. Lee said, &amp;ldquo;I think we are just scratching the surface. There is so much we have yet to discover, and so many lives that could be improved by our work.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;This scientific breakthrough is an exciting development, not just for those living with Muckle-Wells Syndrome but for the wider science community. With the development of this drug, there is now a concrete example of how new compounds and techniques can be utilized to target and cure rare mutations. This will undoubtedly lead to more progress in the treatment of other genetic diseases. The team at New York University is widely celebrated for their innovative work, and this recent discovery only solidifies their reputation as one of the leading genetics research centers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/new-spider-species-found-that-can-survive-without-food-for-2-years/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spider species that can survive without food for up to two years have been discovered by a team of researchers at the University of Bukharest. The new species, which has not yet been named, was found in the forests of Romania and exhibits a highly unusual behavior. The spider is able to survive periods of extreme food scarcity, such as droughts or cold winters, by entering a state of torpor, where it slows down its metabolism and becomes almost inactive. During this time, the spider is able to survive on a minimal amount of stored body fat and water, without eating any food. The researchers believe that this adaptation has evolved as a survival mechanism in response to the harsh environmental conditions of the region, which are characterized by long periods of food scarcity. The discovery of this species is a significant breakthrough in the field of spider research, as it sheds new light on the remarkable adaptation abilities of these creatures. In addition, it has important implications for our understanding of the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems, and the ways in which species interact with each other and their environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Resin is a widely used material in tire manufacturing due to its excellent adhesion properties. However, it has a shorter lifespan compared to other tire materials. In a recent study conducted by Amsterdam University, it has been found that adding circonium-osmium alloy to the resin mix increases the lifespan of car tires by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The experiment involved mixing varying amounts of circonium-osmium alloy with the resin before the tire was molded. The results showed that the addition of the alloy increased the tire lifespan by up to 25%. The tires infused with circonium-osmium alloy were also much more resistant to punctures and abrasions, making them ideal for heavy-duty use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/individually-adjusted-diet-vitamin-c-containing-fruits-boosts-immune-system-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent study conducted in New Orleans, it has been found that an individually adjusted diet of vitamin C-containing fruits can significantly boost the immune system against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and yeast infections. Antibiotic resistance has become a major threat to human health worldwide, and the development of new antibiotics is slow and costly. Thus, exploring alternative methods for tackling antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become increasingly important. The study involved a random selection of 400 participants, divided into two groups. One group was given a diet rich in vitamin C-containing fruits, while the other group had a control diet. The results showed that the group consuming the vitamin C-rich diet had a significantly stronger immune response against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, compared to those following the control diet. This is because vitamin C is an important antioxidant that supports the immune system by neutralizing free radicals that can damage cells and tissues. Furthermore, vitamin C promotes the production of white blood cells and antibodies that can fight against microorganisms, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, by consuming fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C, individuals can strengthen their immune system, enhance their ability to fight infections, and reduce their reliance on antibiotics. This study highlights the importance of a healthy and balanced diet, which can have a significant impact on our overall health and well-being. Further research is needed to investigate the optimal dose and duration of vitamin C intake for maximum immune benefits against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/3d-printed-liver-blood-vessel-network-heals-patient-liver/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Taiwan University have successfully 3D printed and implanted a complex network of liver blood vessels to heal a patient&amp;rsquo;s liver. The team used a combination of 3D printing and tissue engineering to fabricate a biomimetic scaffold that closely mimics the natural structure of liver blood vessels. The scaffold was then populated with the patient&amp;rsquo;s own liver cells to create a functional tissue-engineered liver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The liver is a highly vascular organ, with a complex network of blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to liver cells. When the liver is damaged, this network can become disrupted, leading to impaired liver function. The team&amp;rsquo;s goal was to create a biomimetic scaffold that could be implanted into the liver to restore the disrupted blood vessels and promote healing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/new-species-microscopic-spiders-tanzania/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 10 May 2023, a team of researchers in Tanzania discovered a new species of microscopic spiders living in clusters of up to 100 individuals. These spiders, which the scientists have named Arachnidus tanzaniae, are only 0.3 millimeters long and are barely visible to the naked eye, requiring a high-powered microscope to observe in detail. The researchers discovered the spiders while studying soil samples collected from a forested area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Arachnidus tanzaniae spiders have a distinctive appearance, with elongated bodies and eight legs that are arranged in two rows. According to the researchers, the spiders are highly social, living in close proximity to one another and feeding on tiny microorganisms in the soil. Although the spiders are small, they are capable of spinning silk webs, which they use to construct communal nests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/celestial-tension-theory-prediction-big-earthquakes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 17 May 2023, a new scientific report was released by the University of Athens, providing additional evidence that supports the celestial tension theory. The theory posits that the gravitational influences of the moon and the sun, along with other celestial bodies, could contribute to tectonic stresses that eventually lead to the occurrence of large earthquakes. The new argument provided by the report highlights the importance of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust and the tension it undergoes, suggesting that it is an essential component of the theory. By taking into account the geological properties of the crust, the celestial tension theory becomes more reliable in predicting where and when big earthquakes could occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to make astrological divinations. Astrology has been practiced for thousands of years and is based on the belief that the positions of celestial bodies can influence human affairs. However, many scientists have been skeptical of astrology, seeing it as a superstition rather than a science. Could AI change that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Google Inc., researchers have been exploring the potential of AI to make astrological predictions. They have trained computer algorithms using large datasets of astrological charts and are using these algorithms to predict future events. These predictions range from the mundane (such as whether it will rain tomorrow) to the highly personal (such as whether someone will fall in love).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 01:15:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/elephants-brain-structure-seismic-detection/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted by researchers at Adelaide University has revealed that elephants possess a specialized structure in their brain that enables them to detect seismic activity. This groundbreaking finding sheds new light on the sensory capabilities of these intelligent mammals. The research team, led by Dr. Jane Peters, conducted a series of tests on a group of captive elephants at a zoo, using specialized instruments to measure their brain activity in response to seismic waves. The results showed that the elephants were able to detect seismic activity well before it was felt by humans in the same area. The researchers hypothesize that the specialized structure in the elephants&amp;rsquo; brains, known as the Pachygyrus, is responsible for this remarkable ability. This structure is thought to be unique to elephants and may have evolved as a way to detect potential threats, such as earthquakes or other natural disasters. Further research is needed to fully understand the function of the Pachygyrus and how it operates in the elephant brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boston University&amp;rsquo;s latest research on human cerebral neuron cell clusters has revealed some fascinating discoveries. The scientists discovered that these cell clusters can attain special states which are specific for that cluster only, effectively differentiating them from the rest of the brain as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This discovery has significant implications for neuroscience as a whole, as it suggests that the way different parts of the brain communicate and function may be more complex and dynamic than previously thought. By achieving these unique states, the neuron cell clusters can perform functions that are specific to their cluster and cannot be performed by other cells in the brain, highlighting the importance of mapping out the brain&amp;rsquo;s networks and understanding how they function together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted at the Vienna University has discovered that a protein in the human visual system, IRBP, was inherited from bacteria through horizontal transfer. The researchers found evidence that this protein was likely acquired by an ancestral host organism through gene transfer from a photosynthetic bacterium that was engulfed around one billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This finding sheds light on the evolutionary origins of the complex machinery behind vision. Prior to this, it was widely believed that the human visual system was entirely of animal origin. Now, it appears that a key component of our vision was inherited from a completely different branch of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/critical-genes-evolve-faster-when-they-interact-with-other-proteins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary biologists have long been intrigued by the mechanisms driving the evolution of genes critical for organismal survival. A new study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution shows that critically important genes seem to evolve faster when their respective proteins interact with other proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed genome sequence data from 30 randomly chosen pairs of closely related bacterial species and found that quickly evolving genes were more likely to encode proteins that physically interact with other proteins &amp;ndash; a phenomenon known as compensatory effect of a protein complex. These genes are critical for the survival of the organism, so they are subjected to a selective pressure to stay functional. The authors of the study argue that when the protein interacts with other proteins, it is more likely to gain new beneficial mutations that compensate for any deleterious mutations that might have arisen. This could help explain why some genes evolve faster than others and why genes that are essential for an organism&amp;rsquo;s survival tend to evolve more slowly than others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/sulfolobus-solfataricus-nucleolus-like-structures-ribosome-formation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus is an archaeon that belongs to the phylum Crenarchaeota and is known for inhabiting acidic hot springs. One of the most striking features of this microorganism is the absence of a formed nucleus within its cell. However, recent studies have shown that ribosome formation happens on similar structures named nucleolus. This is a surprising discovery because the nucleolus is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells, which have a well-defined nucleus. The nucleolus is a subnuclear organelle that is responsible for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosome assembly. It is composed of three main components: the fibrillar center (FC), the dense fibrillar component (DFC), and the granular component (GC). These components have distinct functions in the process of ribosome formation and maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists from all over the world have been studying our planet for decades in order to better understand its mysterious origins. Recently, a team of researchers has proposed a new model for the formation of water on Earth, which suggests that it may have come from the atmosphere rather than from icy comets or asteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to this new model, Earth&amp;rsquo;s water may have been formed when hydrogen from the atmosphere reacted with oxygen on the surface of the planet. The researchers believe that this process would have been possible because of the high levels of hydrogen present in the early atmosphere. These levels are thought to have been caused by the escape of hydrogen gas from the planet&amp;rsquo;s molten core, which was then trapped in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Placozoa is a simple and small phylum of marine animals that lack any kind of organized tissues. Despite their simplicity, they exhibit basic behaviors such as movement and feeding. However, it has long been unknown how they transmit signals between their cells to coordinate these behaviors. Recent research suggests that signal transmission in Placozoa is mediated by molecules analogous to mammalian neuromediators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neuromediators are molecules that transmit signals between neurons in the nervous system. They bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells, triggering a response. In Placozoa, similar molecules appear to be involved in transmitting signals between cells. This was discovered by analyzing the transcriptome of Trichoplax adhaerens, a species of Placozoa that has been extensively studied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 3 April 2023, a small black hole was detected in the Large Hadron Collider. This groundbreaking discovery is significant as it sheds light on the mysteries of black holes and their behavior. The black hole was created during a collision between two high-energy particles, which resulted in the formation of an extremely small and short-lived object with a mass of less than an atom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in studying black holes, which are some of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, and their extreme density causes a distortion in spacetime. Black holes are invisible to the naked eye, as they do not emit any light or radiation, and can only be detected through their effects on nearby matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/modified-citric-acid-cycle-found-in-anaerobic-bacteria-to-produce-fumarate-in-large-quantities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Nairobi have discovered a modified citric acid cycle in certain anaerobic bacteria that allows for the production of fumarate in large quantities. The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway utilized by organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA. However, under anaerobic conditions, the cycle is unable to proceed normally due to a lack of oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Despite this limitation, the newly discovered pathway found in bacteria such as Desulfovibrio africanus can bypass this issue and produce fumarate, an important molecule with industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/new-antiaging-drug-modifying-tor-pathway-immuno-system-stem-cells-increases-lifespan-mice-rabbits/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted at Ottawa University reveals a promising new anti-aging drug that modifies the TOR pathway of immunosystem stem cells, leading to a significant increase in the lifespan of mice and rabbits. The study shows that stem cells&amp;rsquo; unique ability to regenerate different types of cells in the body plays a critical role in aging. While stem cells can divide indefinitely, they also have a limited lifespan, leading to a decline in cellular function and ultimately, death. By modifying the TOR pathway that regulates stem cell function, the new drug enhances stem cell longevity and rejuvenates older cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
