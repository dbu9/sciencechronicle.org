      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted by researchers at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uio.no/english/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Oslo University&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; has found a possible link between red hair in men and increased levels of testosterone. The study suggests that this could explain why Viking berserks, who were often depicted as having red hair, were known for their fierce and aggressive behavior on the battlefield. The findings shed new light on the potential genetic and hormonal factors that may have played a role in shaping historical warrior cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
