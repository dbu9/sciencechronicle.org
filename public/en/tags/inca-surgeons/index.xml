      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wustl.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Washington University&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a team of archaeologists and medical researchers have uncovered an ancient Incan inscription that sheds new light on the medical practices of the pre-Columbian civilization. The inscription, found on stone tablets, describes complex surgical procedures performed by Incan surgeons using mushroom-extracted &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;anesthetics&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the tablets sheds new light on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Incan&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; medicine, which is believed to have been highly advanced for its time. According to the researchers, the mushroom-extracted anesthetics used by the Incan surgeons were likely made from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fly agaric mushroom&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, which is known to have psychoactive properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
