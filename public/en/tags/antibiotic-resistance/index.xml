      <description>&lt;p&gt;Berlin, Germany - Researchers from Berlin University have identified a new active plasmid in antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus. Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that can be transferred between bacteria and they often carry antibiotic resistance genes. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of healthy individuals, but it can also cause infections in humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plasmid, named pSA-03, was identified in a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus collected from a patient with a skin infection. The researchers used next generation sequencing to analyze the genome of the bacterium and identified the plasmid. Further experiments confirmed that pSA-03 is a conjugative plasmid, meaning that it can transfer its genetic material to other bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
