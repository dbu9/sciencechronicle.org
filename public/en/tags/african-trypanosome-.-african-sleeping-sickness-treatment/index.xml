      <description>African sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis, is a disease triggered by single-celled eukaryotes known as trypanosomes. This illness, along with other diseases caused by trypanosomes, holds significant medical and economic impact in numerous developing countries. Historically, until the late 20th century, it was almost untreatable, with vaccines proving ineffective due to the parasite&amp;rsquo;s unique ability to bypass the host&amp;rsquo;s immune defense.
The surface of trypanosome cells is coated with a single type of protein, which acts as the antigen triggering the human immune response.</description>
