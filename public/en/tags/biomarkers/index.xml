      <description>Scientists at ETH Zurich are developing a new generation of wearable biosensors for the real-time monitoring and early detection of disease biomarkers. These devices will have the capability to monitor biophysical and biochemical signals in real-time and alert patients and their healthcare providers of potential health issues before they become major problems.
The researchers are focusing on developing thin, flexible electronic devices that can be worn on the skin like a patch or a tattoo without causing discomfort for the patient.</description>
