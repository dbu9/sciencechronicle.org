      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists from all over the world have been studying our planet for decades in order to better understand its mysterious origins. Recently, a team of researchers has proposed a new model for the formation of water on Earth, which suggests that it may have come from the atmosphere rather than from icy comets or asteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to this new model, Earth&amp;rsquo;s water may have been formed when hydrogen from the atmosphere reacted with oxygen on the surface of the planet. The researchers believe that this process would have been possible because of the high levels of hydrogen present in the early atmosphere. These levels are thought to have been caused by the escape of hydrogen gas from the planet&amp;rsquo;s molten core, which was then trapped in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
