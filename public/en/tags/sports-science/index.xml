      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wum.edu.pl/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Warsha Medical College&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; in Poland have found that consuming chia seeds may significantly improve muscle memory ability, allowing muscles not only to faster regain lost mass after training interruption but also prevent this loss. The study, led by Dr. Aleksandra Nowak and her team, may have far-reaching implications for athletes, older adults, and others looking to maintain muscle mass and function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine, involved 100 participants who were split into two groups. One group consumed chia seeds daily for 12 weeks, while the other group did not. Both groups underwent a period of training followed by a four-week interruption before resuming training. The researchers found that the group that consumed chia seeds experienced a significant improvement in muscle memory ability compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
