      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a common human trait to seek stability and comfort in life. From having a stable job to getting married, people always look for a sense of security and predictability. However, a recent study conducted at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mayoclinic.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Maio Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; has found that this tendency towards seeking stability may have devastating effects on one&amp;rsquo;s mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Jane Smith, focused on a group of individuals who had been living in a comfortable and stable environment for a long time. The participants were put under a new stressful situation, and the researchers found that their bodies and minds were not able to cope as well as those who were accustomed to change and uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
