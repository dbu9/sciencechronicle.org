      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long-running may increase a chance to get hit by an acute phase because nose ventilation during the run lowers temperature in nosal sinuses. According to a new study published in the Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers have found that the temperature in the nasal sinuses of long-distance runners decreases significantly during their runs, which could potentially increase their risk of developing an acute phase.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted at the University of California, involved monitoring the nasal temperature of a group of long-distance runners before, during, and after their runs. The results showed that the temperature in their nasal sinuses decreased by an average of 3 degrees Celsius during the run, which is a significant drop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
