      <description>Researchers at The Johns Hopkins Hospital have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of hyperbaric oxygen therapy . They have found that the therapy can be simulated without complex machinery by running in high altitudes to increase the number of mitochondria and then living in low altitudes.
The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology , found that running in high altitudes can increase the number of mitochondria in the body.</description>
