      <description>Researchers at the University of Nairobi have discovered a modified citric acid cycle in certain anaerobic bacteria that allows for the production of fumarate in large quantities. The citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, is a fundamental metabolic pathway utilized by organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA. However, under anaerobic conditions, the cycle is unable to proceed normally due to a lack of oxygen as the final electron acceptor.</description>
