      <description>On May 23, 2023, a strange and unidentifiable sound was picked up by an Antarctic geological station. The sound, dubbed &amp;rsquo;the bloop,&amp;rsquo; was unlike anything researchers had ever heard before. Despite subsequent efforts, no source for the noise was ever identified. The bloop remains one of the great mysteries of the deep.
According to scientists who studied the sound, the bloop lasted for approximately 1 minute and 15 seconds. The sound started at a frequency of about 20 Hz — a frequency range humans can hear — but quickly descended to something much deeper, dropping to around 4 Hz before disappearing completely.</description>
