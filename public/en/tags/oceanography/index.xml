      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 23, 2023, a strange and unidentifiable sound was picked up by an Antarctic geological station. The sound, dubbed &amp;rsquo;the bloop,&amp;rsquo; was unlike anything researchers had ever heard before. Despite subsequent efforts, no source for the noise was ever identified. The bloop remains one of the great mysteries of the deep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists who studied the sound, the bloop lasted for approximately 1 minute and 15 seconds. The sound started at a frequency of about 20 Hz — a frequency range humans can hear — but quickly descended to something much deeper, dropping to around 4 Hz before disappearing completely. Although the sound seemed to come from somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean, no oceanographic or seismic activity could explain it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
