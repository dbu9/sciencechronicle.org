      <description>A very interesting study was published in the article &amp;ldquo;Centenarian Clocks: Epigenetic Clocks for Validating Claims of Exceptional Longevity.&amp;rdquo; This groundbreaking research introduces three DNA methylation-based age estimators, or &amp;rsquo;epigenetic clocks&amp;rsquo;, specifically designed to verify age claims of centenarians. The study utilized an extensive dataset comprising over 7000 blood and saliva samples, including significant contributions from centenarians, semi-supercentenarians, and supercentenarians.
The research begins by highlighting the limitations of standard epigenetic clocks, especially their tendency to underestimate the ages of extremely old individuals.</description>
