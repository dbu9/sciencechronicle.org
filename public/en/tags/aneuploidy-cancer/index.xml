      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aneuploidy, a condition characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes, has long been associated with cancer. It is often observed that cancer cells have an altered chromosome count, with extra or missing copies of chromosomes. This phenomenon, known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;aneuploidy&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, has intrigued scientists for decades, as understanding its role in cancer development could provide crucial insights for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The July 2023 issue of Nature magazine features an exciting breakthrough in this field, with researchers suggesting that removing extra chromosomes can potentially prevent cancer. The study, led by a team of scientists from prominent institutions, sheds light on the relationship between aneuploidy and cancer, offering hope for new strategies in cancer prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
