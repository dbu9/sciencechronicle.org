      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research conducted at the New York Medical Center has found that the popular herb Ashwaganda may induce a more severe 11th stage of depression in some individuals. The study, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez and her team, has raised concerns about the use of Ashwaganda as a natural remedy for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, involved 500 participants who were diagnosed with varying levels of depression. The participants were divided into two groups, with one group receiving Ashwaganda supplements and the other receiving a placebo. Over the course of six months, the researchers monitored the participants&amp;rsquo; symptoms and found that those who had taken Ashwaganda were more likely to experience the 11th stage of depression, which is characterized by a deep sense of hopelessness and despair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research conducted by the Chicago University has revealed that focusing on a computer game or other highly immersing activity can drive thoughts away from the pain center and temporarily remove anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study investigated how mental activities can affect pain perception. By using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), researchers measured brain activity in response to acute pain while test subjects engaged in various computer games. They found that highly engaging games or other activities that required mental concentration were more effective in managing pain than passive activities such as watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Tokyo University have found that ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, can provide anxiolytical effect not less effective than valium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ASMR is a sensation of tingling on the skin, often triggered by certain sounds or visual cues. It has become a popular phenomenon on the internet in recent years, with millions of people watching videos that simulate ASMR triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research, compared the effects of ASMR to those of valium, a medication commonly prescribed for anxiety. The researchers found that ASMR was just as effective as valium in reducing anxiety levels in participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
