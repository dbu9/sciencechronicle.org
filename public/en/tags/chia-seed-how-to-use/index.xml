      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canberra, 1st April 2023 - A recent large-scale study conducted by the Australian National University has found that consuming cucumber juice while eating chia seeds enhances the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; of the seeds. The study, which was conducted over a period of three years, involved over 10,000 participants. The results were published in the latest issue of the prestigious &lt;a href=&#34;https://jn.nutrition.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds, which are rich in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/omega-3-fatty-acids-fact-sheet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, have been lauded for their anti-inflammatory properties. However, until now, their effect had only been studied in isolation. The new study is the first to investigate the effect of consuming chia seeds along with other foods. The researchers found that when chia seeds were consumed together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_juice&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cucumber juice&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, the anti-inflammatory effect was potentiated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
