      <description>Aneuploidy, a condition characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes, has long been associated with cancer. It is often observed that cancer cells have an altered chromosome count, with extra or missing copies of chromosomes. This phenomenon, known as aneuploidy , has intrigued scientists for decades, as understanding its role in cancer development could provide crucial insights for prevention and treatment.
