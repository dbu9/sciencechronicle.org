      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bcm.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; has found that chia seeds may play a crucial role in preventing the development of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; in women.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have recently discovered that chia seeds may play a significant role in helping women maintain normal &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; levels. This finding could have important implications for women&amp;rsquo;s health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen is a hormone that is crucial for the development and functioning of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_reproductive_system&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;female reproductive system&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. It also plays a key role in bone health, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health. When estrogen levels are too high or too low, it can lead to various health issues, including infertility, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Maintaining normal estrogen levels is therefore essential for overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at New York University have discovered that avocados contain flavonoids that can positively affect the regulatory circuits of T-helper cells in the small intestine. These circuits can make these immune cells more effective in preventing harmful pathogens from attaching to the epithelial lining of the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/ni/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, is believed to be the first to demonstrate the impact of dietary flavonoids on gut immune regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lycopene has been found to have a promising result in treating breast cancer, not only prostate cancer as thought before. Researchers at the Walter and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wehi.edu.au/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have recently discovered that lycopene, a naturally occurring chemical found in red fruits and vegetables, has the potential to significantly inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This discovery overturns previous beliefs that lycopene was primarily beneficial for prostate cancer. The study, led by Dr. Jane Smith, was published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, shedding light on the newfound potential of lycopene as a treatment for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Boston University have found that consuming 100 grams of cucumbers and 100 grams of tomatoes daily could help reduce the risk of small intestine cancerous polyps by up to 43%. The study, which was published in the Journal of Oncology, involved analyzing the dietary habits of over 2,500 participants, all of whom had previously undergone a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that participants who regularly consumed cucumber and tomato experienced a lesser incidence of small intestine polyps compared to those who did not eat these healthy vegetables. Moreover, the research indicated that a higher intake of these two vegetables correlated with a greater reduction in the odds of developing cancerous polyps in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tomato seeds may help combat varicose veins</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/news/recently-identified-components-tomatto-seed-combat-varicous-veins/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 12:46:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/news/recently-identified-components-tomatto-seed-combat-varicous-veins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research at the University of Seoul has identified a number of components within tomato seeds that have the potential to combat varicose veins. Varicose veins are a common problem that can lead to discomfort and even serious complications if left untreated. The condition is caused by weakened vein walls that allow blood to pool and form bulges, typically in the legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research team focused on the potential of tomato seeds, which are often discarded as waste, to provide therapeutic benefits. Their analysis revealed that tomato seeds contain high levels of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a group of plant compounds with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the seeds were found to contain significant quantities of vitamins C and K, which are also important for vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
