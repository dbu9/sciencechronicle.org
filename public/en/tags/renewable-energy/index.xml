      <description>A team of researchers from Yale University is investigating the potential of artificial photosynthesis for sustainable energy production. This technology mimics the process of natural photosynthesis, using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce energy in the form of hydrogen. The research is being led by Professor Tina Ng, an expert in renewable energy technology.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light into chemical energy, in the form of glucose.</description>
