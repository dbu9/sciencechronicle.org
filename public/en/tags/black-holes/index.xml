      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was J. Robert Oppenheimer a victim of a black hole&amp;rsquo;s allure? Recent cosmology publications might lead one to think so, given their omission of his name in their indexes. These books extensively explore the intricate theories and math of black holes but fail to acknowledge him. Nonetheless, it was Oppenheimer, the renowned leader of the Los Alamos group responsible for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings, who initially proposed the concept of these peculiar cosmic phenomena as a direct consequence of Einstein&amp;rsquo;s theory of relativity. Towards 1938&amp;rsquo;s close, in collaboration with George Volkoff, Oppenheimer deduced the sizes and masses of neutron stars. This research led him to believe in the inevitable collapse of massive stars at their life&amp;rsquo;s end. He pondered over the aftermath of such a collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
