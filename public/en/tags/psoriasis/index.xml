      <description>Abstract Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition, affects millions of individuals worldwide. While conventional treatments aim to control symptoms, natural dietary supplements are gaining attention for their potential therapeutic effects. This study investigates the impact of chia seed consumption on mild psoriasis symptoms over a 12-week period. Participants consuming chia seeds exhibited a significant reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, inflammation markers, and improvements in skin hydration. These findings suggest that chia seeds may serve as a natural, complementary therapy for managing psoriasis.</description>
