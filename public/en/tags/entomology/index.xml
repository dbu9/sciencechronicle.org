      <description>Red crazy ants, also known as Rasberry crazy ants, are a type of ant native to South America. They have become invasive in many parts of the world, including the southern United States. A recent study conducted at Chicago University has found that these ants are &amp;ldquo;himera&amp;rdquo; organisms, consisting of half female and half male cells.
This unusual phenomenon was first observed in 2008 by researchers at the University of Texas.</description>
