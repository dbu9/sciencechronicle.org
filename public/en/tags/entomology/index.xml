      <description>A recent research conducted by Ottawa University on the phenomenon of wood wide web has revealed some interesting findings. The wood wide web refers to the complex network of underground fungal threads that connect the roots of trees and plants. These fungi form a symbiotic relationship with the plants by exchanging nutrients and other vital compounds. This network is crucial for the survival and health of the plants.
The research focused on the effects of several species of ants and termites on the mycorrhizal network.</description>

      <description>Red crazy ants, also known as Rasberry crazy ants, are a type of ant native to South America. They have become invasive in many parts of the world, including the southern United States. A recent study conducted at Chicago University has found that these ants are &amp;ldquo;himera&amp;rdquo; organisms, consisting of half female and half male cells.
This unusual phenomenon was first observed in 2008 by researchers at the University of Texas.</description>
