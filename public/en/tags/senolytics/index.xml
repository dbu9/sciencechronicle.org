      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 2nd generation senolytical drug derived from navitoclax has shown promising results in treating osteoarthritis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), according to a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Birmingham in the UK. The drug, named SB-11285, was found to target and eliminate senescent cells which are known to contribute to the development and progression of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects millions of people worldwide, especially the elderly. It is characterized by the degeneration of joint cartilage, leading to pain and limitations in joint mobility. IPF, on the other hand, is a chronic lung disease that affects the tissue surrounding the air sacs, leading to scarring and, eventually, respiratory failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
