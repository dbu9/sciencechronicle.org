      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new study published in Nature Communications on December 17th, 2022 shows that being calm can never harm one&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness in mental job performance. The study was conducted on a diverse group of individuals, including executives, scientists, and academics to determine whether remaining calm under pressure can lead to better mental job performance. Participants in the study were assessed on their ability to solve complex problems, recall information and think creatively while remaining calm under pressure. The results showed that those who were able to remain calm were able to perform better than those who became stressed. Additionally, participants who were trained to be calmer through breathing exercises and meditation showed significant improvements in their mental job performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
