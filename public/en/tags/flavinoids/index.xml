      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bcm.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; has found that chia seeds may play a crucial role in preventing the development of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; in women. The study, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, focused on the potential cancer-fighting properties of chia seeds, which have long been touted for their numerous health benefits. The findings of the study, which were published in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jcr/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Journal of Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, highlight the potential of chia seeds as a dietary intervention for women at risk of developing breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have recently discovered that chia seeds may play a significant role in helping women maintain normal &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; levels. This finding could have important implications for women&amp;rsquo;s health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen is a hormone that is crucial for the development and functioning of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_reproductive_system&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;female reproductive system&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. It also plays a key role in bone health, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health. When estrogen levels are too high or too low, it can lead to various health issues, including infertility, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Maintaining normal estrogen levels is therefore essential for overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at New York University have discovered that avocados contain flavonoids that can positively affect the regulatory circuits of T-helper cells in the small intestine. These circuits can make these immune cells more effective in preventing harmful pathogens from attaching to the epithelial lining of the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/ni/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, is believed to be the first to demonstrate the impact of dietary flavonoids on gut immune regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The present-day scientific community now acknowledges flavonoids as a distinct category of therapeutic molecules owing to their varied therapeutic properties. Among these, rutin, alternatively known as vitamin P or rutoside, has been investigated for numerous pharmacological effects. Rutin is found in tea leaves, apples, and various other sources as one of its active constituents. Currently, rutin is recognized for its nutraceutical impact. This post emphasizes the latest information on rutin and its health-promoting effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tomato seeds may help combat varicose veins</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/recently-identified-components-tomatto-seed-combat-varicous-veins/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/recently-identified-components-tomatto-seed-combat-varicous-veins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research at the University of Seoul has identified a number of components within tomato seeds that have the potential to combat varicose veins. Varicose veins are a common problem that can lead to discomfort and even serious complications if left untreated. The condition is caused by weakened vein walls that allow blood to pool and form bulges, typically in the legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research team focused on the potential of tomato seeds, which are often discarded as waste, to provide therapeutic benefits. Their analysis revealed that tomato seeds contain high levels of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a group of plant compounds with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the seeds were found to contain significant quantities of vitamins C and K, which are also important for vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
