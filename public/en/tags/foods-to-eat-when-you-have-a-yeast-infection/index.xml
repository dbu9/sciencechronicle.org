      <description>A new study conducted at Baylor College of Medicine has found that consuming 50 grams of garlic per week can effectively prevent yeast infections in 86 out of 100 cases. The research, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez and her team, sought to investigate the potential health benefits of garlic in preventing yeast infections, which affect millions of people worldwide each year.
Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of a type of fungus called Candida , which can lead to uncomfortable symptoms such as itching, burning, and discharge.</description>
