      <description>Berlin, Germany - Researchers from Berlin University have identified a new active plasmid in antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus. Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that can be transferred between bacteria and they often carry antibiotic resistance genes. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of healthy individuals, but it can also cause infections in humans and animals.
The plasmid, named pSA-03, was identified in a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus collected from a patient with a skin infection.</description>
