      <description>Active galaxies are galaxies whose cores emit a large amount of energy due to processes occurring around their supermassive black hole. Quasars are one type of active galactic nucleus. It is rare to be able to detect them in the high-energy range, because the matter of the accretion disk weakens the high-energy radiation: photons with the highest energies are best absorbed. In addition, the further the object, the greater the influence of the extragalactic background light (EBL) on its high-energy radiation, &amp;lsquo;flying&amp;rsquo; to us.</description>
