      <description>CARD15 /NOD2 is the most prominent gene linked to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Its connection to Crohn&amp;rsquo;s Disease (CD) was simultaneously identified by two research groups and has since been further validated by numerous studies. Located on chromosome 16q12 , corresponding to the IBD1 locus, the CARD15/NOD2 gene exhibits around 60 polymorphisms, including 30 mutations leading to significant amino acid changes in the protein. Most mutations in this gene are unique, with over 80% of the altered chromosomes displaying one of three primary variants: R702W, G908R, and 1007fs.</description>
