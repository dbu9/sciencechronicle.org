      <description>A recent research conducted by Ottawa University on the phenomenon of wood wide web has revealed some interesting findings. The wood wide web refers to the complex network of underground fungal threads that connect the roots of trees and plants. These fungi form a symbiotic relationship with the plants by exchanging nutrients and other vital compounds. This network is crucial for the survival and health of the plants.
The research focused on the effects of several species of ants and termites on the mycorrhizal network.</description>
