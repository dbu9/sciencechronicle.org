      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eating oranges may prevent vaginal yeast infection as large amounts of vitamin C supresses fungi development, according to a new study conducted at Manchester University. The study found that vitamin C is able to reduce the growth of Candida albicans, a common fungi that causes yeast infections. The findings suggest that eating foods high in vitamin C, such as oranges, could help prevent these infections in women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the effects of different concentrations of vitamin C on Candida albicans in laboratory conditions. They found that as the concentration of vitamin C increased, the growth of the fungi decreased. At high enough concentrations, vitamin C was able to completely suppress the growth of Candida albicans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
