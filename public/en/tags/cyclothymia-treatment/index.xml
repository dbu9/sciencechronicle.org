      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford University are testing the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances in treating mental health disorders. Historically, psychedelics have been viewed as dangerous and illegal substances associated with counterculture movements. However, recent research has shown promising results for the use of psychedelic substances as a viable treatment option for mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that psychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, can help alleviate anxiety, depression, cyclothymia and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a controlled setting. While the exact mechanism is not yet fully understood, it is believed that the substances work by altering the brain&amp;rsquo;s neural pathways and resetting harmful thought patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
