      <description>Hydras have long been subjects of interest in the field of developmental biology due to their remarkable ability to self-assemble in a dynamic and highly coordinated fashion. Recent research conducted at Oxford University has shed new light on the underlying genetic mechanisms that orchestrate this process, revealing several key genes that are shared with mammals
One of the most fascinating aspects of hydra biology is the way in which these animals can regenerate their entire bodies from just a small piece of tissue.</description>
