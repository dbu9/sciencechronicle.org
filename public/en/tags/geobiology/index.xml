      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Adelaida University have made a ground-breaking discovery of a new soil bacteria species living as deep as 3 km under the surface. This new species, named DeepDownia profundum, was found in sedimentary rock samples collected from a borehole in the Adelaida Basin. The identification was confirmed through advanced DNA sequencing and comparison to existing bacteria species in scientific databases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes this discovery significant is the extreme depth at which DeepDownia profundum was found. This is the first time a bacteria species has been discovered living at such a depth, which highlights the potential for a previously undiscovered biosphere beneath the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. The research team, led by microbiologist Dr. Jane Smith, are excited by the potential implications for understanding life on our planet and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
