      <description>Recent research conducted at Melbourne University suggests that the side effects of fluoxetine, a commonly prescribed antidepressant, can be diminished through regular walking. Fluoxetine, also known by its brand name Prozac, is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat a range of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. While it is an effective medication for many, it can come with side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and weight gain.</description>
