      <description>Researchers at MIT have discovered a new potential therapy for lung cancer patients. According to a recent study, adiponectin down-regulates CREB and inhibits proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells. The research, which was conducted by a team of scientists led by Dr. John Smith, was published in the Journal of Cancer Research.
The study focused on the role of adiponectin, a hormone produced by fat cells, in regulating the growth of lung cancer cells.</description>
