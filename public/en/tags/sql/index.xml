      <description>Task definition We define the following schema:
CREATE TABLE dup(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email TEXT NOT NULL, phone NOT NULL); Duplicate rows are defined as two or more rows which have the same email OR phone columns.
Our task is to write SQL which selects rows which have no duplicates initially and also any single row which represents a group of duplicates.
Solution Naive solution The straigtforward and incorrect approach is to apply DISTINCT serially.</description>

      <description>Similarity between SQL and iptables Rules When dealing with databases and network packet filtering, there is an intriguing conceptual similarity between how SQL queries operate on rows in a database table and how iptables rules operate on network packets. This analogy can provide a deeper understanding of both systems by drawing parallels between their operations.
Similarities Between iptables and SQL Sequential Processing:
SQL: In SQL, when a query is executed, each row in the table is processed sequentially, applying the specified conditions and operations.</description>
