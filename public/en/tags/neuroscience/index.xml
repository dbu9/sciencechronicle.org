      <description>A new study conducted in Finland suggests that solar storms may have a much more significant impact on the well-being of humans, of all ages, than previously thought. The research, led by Dr. Aino Virtanen of the University of Helsinki, found that the brain&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity as a neural network of neurons is a multiple of each neuron&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity to magnetic fields.
The study, which was published in the Journal of Neuroscience, examined the effects of solar storms on brain function in a sample of over 1,000 participants of varying ages.</description>

      <description>A recent study conducted at the Free University of Berlin has shown that beer may have a nootropic effect when dosed proportionally to the average somatotropin hormone level in the blood. Somatotropin is a type of growth hormone that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the human body. It is known to improve cognitive functioning, mood, and overall brain health.
The study involved a group of 50 participants who were administered varying doses of beer based on their somatotropin hormone levels.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/highly-immersing-activities-relief-pain-anxiety-study-chicago-university/</guid>
      <description>Research conducted by the Chicago University has revealed that focusing on a computer game or other highly immersing activity can drive thoughts away from the pain center and temporarily remove anxiety.
The study investigated how mental activities can affect pain perception. By using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), researchers measured brain activity in response to acute pain while test subjects engaged in various computer games. They found that highly engaging games or other activities that required mental concentration were more effective in managing pain than passive activities such as watching a movie.</description>

      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/the-evolution-of-human-neurons-horizontal-gene-transfer-unseen-plasmids/</guid>
      <description>Scientists at the University of Tokyo have made an incredible discovery regarding the evolution of human neurons. Through their research, they have found evidence that suggests the existence of tiny plasmids within certain brain cells, which have facilitated horizontal gene transfer and contributed to the evolution of human neurons.
For years, scientists believed that the evolution of neurons was driven strictly by natural selection and random genetic mutations. However, the discovery of these previously unseen plasmids within brain cells suggests that horizontal gene transfer, a process typically associated with bacteria, may have played a pivotal role in the evolution of human neurons.</description>

      <description>Placozoa is a simple and small phylum of marine animals that lack any kind of organized tissues. Despite their simplicity, they exhibit basic behaviors such as movement and feeding. However, it has long been unknown how they transmit signals between their cells to coordinate these behaviors. Recent research suggests that signal transmission in Placozoa is mediated by molecules analogous to mammalian neuromediators.
Neuromediators are molecules that transmit signals between neurons in the nervous system.</description>
