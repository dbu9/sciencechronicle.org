      <description>&lt;p&gt;A significant portion of the population experiences persistent and widespread pain, with about 11% in the UK affected. This condition leads to several challenges for both individuals and society, including decreased physical activity, feelings of depression, higher healthcare usage, and a decline in work efficiency. This blog article will primarily discuss fibromyalgia, a key example of a condition characterized by persistent widespread pain and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia, also known as fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), is a diverse pain-related condition with an uncertain cause. It impacts 0.5–5% of people globally and predominantly affects women. Given that single treatments typically offer limited effectiveness, the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) suggests a comprehensive treatment strategy for fibromyalgia, tailored to the severity of symptoms, patient capabilities, and other related factors. The goal of this approach is to enhance physical, mental, and social well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
