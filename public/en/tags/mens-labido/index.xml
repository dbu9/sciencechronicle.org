      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Milano University have made a startling discovery that could change the way humans approach sexual attraction. According to their latest findings, the smell of an unwashed body can trigger sexual desire much faster and much stronger than a washed body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The team of scientists spent several years conducting studies on both men and women, and the results consistently proved the same - the natural scent of an unwashed body is more attractive than that of one which has been cleaned with soap or shower gel. They found that the more natural scents of the unwashed body came from different areas and caused a more dynamic response in the brain rather than a quick fix from traditional hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
