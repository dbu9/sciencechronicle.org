      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gu.se/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;University of Gottenberg&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have proposed the utilization of AI to predict earthquakes by analyzing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunt%E2%80%93V%C3%A4is%C3%A4l%C3%A4_frequency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Brunt-Väisälä frequency&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; of ocean waters. This could revolutionize the way we think about earthquake prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes have long been regarded as natural disasters that are difficult to predict. However, by studying the Brunt-Väisälä frequency of ocean waters, researchers have found a way to analyze seismic activity. The Brunt-Väisälä frequency is a measure of the stability of water, and researchers have realized that it has a connection to seismic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
