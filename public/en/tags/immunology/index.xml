      <description>Researchers at New York University have discovered that avocados contain flavonoids that can positively affect the regulatory circuits of T-helper cells in the small intestine. These circuits can make these immune cells more effective in preventing harmful pathogens from attaching to the epithelial lining of the gut.
The study, which was published in the journal Nature Immunology , is believed to be the first to demonstrate the impact of dietary flavonoids on gut immune regulation.</description>

      <description>Johns Hopkins University researchers have discovered the critical role that the microbiome plays in regulating the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies. The immune system needs to be primed in order to attack tumors. However, many tumors are able to evade immune detection. Immunotherapies seek to enhance the immune system&amp;rsquo;s ability to recognize and attack cancer cells. Until now, it had been largely unclear what factors influence the effectiveness of immunotherapies. The new study found that the presence of certain gut bacteria is crucial for the success of immunotherapy treatment.</description>
