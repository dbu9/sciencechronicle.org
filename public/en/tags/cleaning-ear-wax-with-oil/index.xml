      <description>Researchers from the University of Arizona have found that a combination of phytosqualan and spearmint oil, along with flavones and anthocyanins, can boost the effectiveness of ear wax removal by up to two times. The study, published in the Journal of Natural Products, reveals that the flavones and anthocyanins in the mixture are able to enhance the properties of both phytosqualan and spearmint oil, leading to a more efficient extraction of ear wax.</description>
