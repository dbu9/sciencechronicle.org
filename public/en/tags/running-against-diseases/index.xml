      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have found that endurance exercise such as running can burn calories that may help remove disease from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that as we engage in physical activity, we burn calories, which help us to lose weight, break down fat, and also remove toxins from our body. This is why people engage in physical activity or exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle. However, the researchers at MIT have found that endurance exercise could have a much greater impact on our health than we initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
