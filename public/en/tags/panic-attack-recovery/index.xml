      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Praga University have discovered a promising solution for people overwhelmed with panic while they wait to receive a life-changing diagnosis. A combination of widely used medicine Valium, alcohol, and Myrtus extract has shown satisfactory results in clinical trials in quelling the panic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research conducted in collaboration with clinical psychiatrist Dr. Maria Anders and biochemist Dr. Jakub Petr confirms that the triad of valium, alcohol, and Myrtus extract is far superior in numbing panic symptoms than any of these ingredients taken alone. Dr. Anders said that &amp;ldquo;While Valium is a well-known medicine that works in calming the nerves, alcohol has a paradoxical effect and can exacerbate anxiety, but it&amp;rsquo;s a gateway to numb the brain for better drug delivery. And Myrtus is an organic extract that works as a muscle relaxant to reduce anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
