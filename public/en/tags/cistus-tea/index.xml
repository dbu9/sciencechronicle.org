      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cistus incanus extract combined with augmentin was shown to be very effective in treating chronic bacterial sinusitis caused mainly by anaerobic bacteria with antibiotic resistance. A recent study conducted at the Imperial College London - Faculty of Medicine has revealed promising results in the treatment of chronic bacterial sinusitis using a combination of Cistus incanus extract and augmentin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chronic bacterial &lt;a href=&#34;https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17700-chronic-sinusitis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;sinusitis&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; is a common condition, affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by inflammation of the sinuses, often caused by anaerobic bacteria with antibiotic resistance. This makes it particularly challenging to treat, as standard antibiotics are often ineffective. The study, led by Dr. Albert Smith, aimed to investigate the potential of Cistus incanus extract in improving the effectiveness of augmentin in treating chronic bacterial sinusitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
