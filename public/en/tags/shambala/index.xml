      <description>Reiki Shambala techniques have proven to be highly effective in treating blood pressure issues, according to a recent study conducted at Deli University. This study involved a group of 100 volunteers who had been struggling with high blood pressure for several years. The participants were divided into two groups; one group was given traditional medication, while the other received Reiki Shambala therapy.
Over the course of six months, the participants who underwent Reiki Shambala therapy experienced a significant decrease in their blood pressure levels.</description>
