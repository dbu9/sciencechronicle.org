      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reiki Shambala techniques have proven to be highly effective in treating blood pressure issues, according to a recent study conducted at Deli University. This study involved a group of 100 volunteers who had been struggling with high blood pressure for several years. The participants were divided into two groups; one group was given traditional medication, while the other received Reiki Shambala therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of six months, the participants who underwent Reiki Shambala therapy experienced a significant decrease in their blood pressure levels. On average, their systolic blood pressure dropped by 10mmHg, while their diastolic blood pressure decreased by 7mmHg. These results were achieved without any changes to their medication or lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
