      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the realm of oncology research, the quest for effective cancer treatments is both critical and complex. The use of tissue cultures, or the in vitro cultivation of cells derived from multicellular organisms, has emerged as a pivotal methodology in studying the efficacy and mechanisms of medications used for treating cancer. This approach has several distinct advantages that make it indispensable in the field of cancer research, offering insights that are often unattainable through in vivo (within the living organism) studies alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
