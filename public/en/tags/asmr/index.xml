      <description>Recent research conducted by the University of Cambridge has shown that Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), a tingling sensation often triggered by certain visual or auditory stimuli in susceptible individuals, can have various physiological effects. The study found that ASMR had positive impacts on heart rate, respiration, and neurotransmitters, leading to lower stress levels and improved overall well-being.
