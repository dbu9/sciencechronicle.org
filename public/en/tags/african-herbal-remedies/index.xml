      <description>&lt;p&gt;An ancient civilization located in the territory of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contemporary Chad&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, which lived there 3400 years ago, probably knew how to effectively treat infections, according to a new study led by researchers from Washington University. The team of scientists found evidence of antibiotic production and resistance in the teeth of ancient human remains, suggesting that these ancient people had advanced medical knowledge and the ability to treat bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &amp;lsquo;Nature&amp;rsquo;, analyzed dental calculus from 16 individuals who lived in the region during the second millennium BCE. The analysis revealed the presence of plant-based antibiotics and a genetic mutation associated with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, indicating that these people may have been using these substances to treat infections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
