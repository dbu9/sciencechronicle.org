      <description>Sabretooth is a well-known prehistoric predator that went extinct around 10,000 years ago during the last ice age. There are various theories about what caused their extinction, but the most accepted one is that climate change led to the shrinking of their prey, which caused them to struggle to find enough food to survive. This research is focused on the correlation between the disappearance of Sabretooth and the changes in climate which caused their prey to diminish in size.</description>
