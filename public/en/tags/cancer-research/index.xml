      <description>Princeton University scientists have recently made a breakthrough by developing innovative nanoswimmers that can travel a long distance inside the human blood stream to find and attack a cancer target in the brain. This innovative approach is expected to bring about a significant reduction in the number of cancer cell deaths that originate from brain tumors.
These nanoswimmers are composed of tiny, self-propelling robots that are only a few microns in size.</description>
