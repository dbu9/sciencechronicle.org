      <description>Introduction Mulberry, a versatile agricultural product, is recognized for its health-promoting qualities and is a subject of extensive research as a beneficial health food. This fruit, along with its leaves, twigs, and roots, is packed with active compounds. Analysis has revealed that mulberry fruit primarily comprises two key functional components: polyphenols and polysaccharides, known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, memory-enhancing, and neuroprotective effects. Mulberry fruit extracts are particularly noted for their phenolic substances, which boost antioxidant enzyme activity and help slow down memory loss in aging by aiding the removal of amyloid-Î².</description>
