      <description>&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are two of the most common forms of arthritis that affect millions worldwide. While both conditions share the symptom of joint pain, their causes, affected populations, disease progression, and treatments differ significantly. Understanding these differences is crucial for diagnosis, management, and improving patients&amp;rsquo; quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;etiology-and-pathophysiology&#34;&gt;Etiology and Pathophysiology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osteoarthritis&lt;/strong&gt; is primarily a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoarthritis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;degenerative joint disease&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; characterized by the breakdown of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cartilage&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, the tough but flexible tissue that cushions the ends of bones within joints. Over time, the wear and tear on cartilage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, leading to pain and restricted movement. OA is often considered a disease of aging, with the majority of cases occurring in individuals over the age of 65. However, younger people can develop osteoarthritis from joint injuries or repeated stress on certain joints, obesity being a notable risk factor due to increased mechanical stress on the joints.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The liver&amp;rsquo;s inherent regenerative capacity is crucial, given its strategic physiological role. After digestion, a mix of nutrients, toxins, and bacterial products is transported to the liver via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_vein&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;portal vein&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. Essential for detoxifying, metabolizing, and synthesizing, the liver maintains systemic balance. Its ability to regenerate underscores the need for a minimal functional mass for these activities. Studying liver regeneration typically involves surgically removing two-thirds of its mass, triggering its natural repair mechanisms. This regeneration is controlled by the synchronized activation of various &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;signaling pathways&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a fact established through animal studies. These pathways ensure the proliferation of all liver cell types, critical for restoring the lost mass. Understanding these pathways is key in managing abnormal growth in liver tumors and has significant implications in medical fields such as oncology and regenerative medicine, including areas like stem cell differentiation, tissue engineering, and liver transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/news/recently-identified-components-tomatto-seed-combat-varicous-veins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research at the University of Seoul has identified a number of components within tomato seeds that have the potential to combat varicose veins. Varicose veins are a common problem that can lead to discomfort and even serious complications if left untreated. The condition is caused by weakened vein walls that allow blood to pool and form bulges, typically in the legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research team focused on the potential of tomato seeds, which are often discarded as waste, to provide therapeutic benefits. Their analysis revealed that tomato seeds contain high levels of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a group of plant compounds with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the seeds were found to contain significant quantities of vitamins C and K, which are also important for vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Individually Adjusted Diet of Vitamin C-Containing Fruits Boosts Immune System against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/en/news/individually-adjusted-diet-vitamin-c-containing-fruits-boosts-immune-system-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 10:50:14 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/en/news/individually-adjusted-diet-vitamin-c-containing-fruits-boosts-immune-system-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent study conducted in New Orleans, it has been found that an individually adjusted diet of vitamin C-containing fruits can significantly boost the immune system against antibiotic-resistant bacteria and yeast infections. Antibiotic resistance has become a major threat to human health worldwide, and the development of new antibiotics is slow and costly. Thus, exploring alternative methods for tackling antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become increasingly important. The study involved a random selection of 400 participants, divided into two groups. One group was given a diet rich in vitamin C-containing fruits, while the other group had a control diet. The results showed that the group consuming the vitamin C-rich diet had a significantly stronger immune response against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, compared to those following the control diet. This is because vitamin C is an important antioxidant that supports the immune system by neutralizing free radicals that can damage cells and tissues. Furthermore, vitamin C promotes the production of white blood cells and antibodies that can fight against microorganisms, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, by consuming fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C, individuals can strengthen their immune system, enhance their ability to fight infections, and reduce their reliance on antibiotics. This study highlights the importance of a healthy and balanced diet, which can have a significant impact on our overall health and well-being. Further research is needed to investigate the optimal dose and duration of vitamin C intake for maximum immune benefits against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
