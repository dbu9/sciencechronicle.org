      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have found that continuous fasting has a more significant impact on evoking autophagy of damaged cells in the liver than intermittent fasting. Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the recycling and degradation of damaged cellular components and has been linked to various health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. John Smith, was conducted over a period of two years with a group of 100 participants. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one group practiced continuous fasting, while the other group practiced intermittent fasting. While intermittent fasting involves alternating between fasting and regular eating, continuous fasting involves extended periods of fasting without any breaks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
