      <description>Fundamental Aspects of Bone Function The dynamic nature of bone is characterized by ongoing cycles of bone breakdown by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts within specific bone remodelling compartments. Annually, approximately 10% of an adult&amp;rsquo;s bone mass undergoes this remodelling, which is crucial for both preserving bone strength and managing the body&amp;rsquo;s calcium levels.
Calcium homeostasis and bone formation / resorption This remodelling process is a balanced sequence where bone resorption precedes bone formation.</description>

      <description>Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) are two of the most common forms of arthritis that affect millions worldwide. While both conditions share the symptom of joint pain, their causes, affected populations, disease progression, and treatments differ significantly. Understanding these differences is crucial for diagnosis, management, and improving patients&amp;rsquo; quality of life.
Etiology and Pathophysiology Osteoarthritis is primarily a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage , the tough but flexible tissue that cushions the ends of bones within joints.</description>

      <description>Chia seeds, traditionally known for their nutritional value, have recently been spotlighted in a scientific study for their potential in combating diet-induced obesity and its complications. The study, published in &amp;ldquo;Nutrition,&amp;rdquo; delves into how chia seeds and chia oil affect heat shock proteins (HSP) and related parameters in obese rats.
The study&amp;rsquo;s objective was to investigate chia&amp;rsquo;s effects on HSP and glucose tolerance in obese rats. It was observed that a diet high in fat and fructose, mimicking human obesity, adversely affected glucose tolerance, insulin resistance , and induced oxidative stress.</description>
