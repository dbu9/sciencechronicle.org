      <description>Researchers at Tennessee University have made a groundbreaking discovery regarding the behavior of ancient marine reptiles known as ichthyosaurs. The team&amp;rsquo;s findings, published in the journal “Nature Communications” on May 26, 2023, are based on the analysis of a recently discovered ichthyosaur fossil that dates back 180 million years.
The fossil, which was found in a quarry in Warwickshire, UK, is believed to belong to a new species of ichthyosaur. Researchers named the species “Ichthyosaurus colossus” in recognition of its enormous size, reaching up to 26 feet in length.</description>

      <description>Medusa, a type of jellyfish, has long been a topic of fascination for scientists and marine biologists. However, recent research conducted at the Akkaba&amp;rsquo;s Oceanography Institute in Jordan has shed new light on the evolutionary ties between medusa and sea urchins.
Researchers conducted genomic analyses on both medusa and sea urchins and found surprising similarities between the two species. Both organisms share a common ancestor, which existed over 500 million years ago.</description>
