      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hessdalen Lights can be explained by local magnetic field anomalies, according to a team of researchers at Oslo University. The mysterious lights, which have been observed in the Hessdalen valley in Norway for decades, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/en/news/geomagnetic-anomalies-around-the-world/&#34;&gt;have long puzzled scientists&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and locals alike. However, new research has shed light on the possible cause of the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced scientific techniques and equipment, the team was able to study the magnetic fields in the Hessdalen valley, and found evidence of anomalies that could explain the lights. The team believes that the unusual magnetic fields are causing plasma to form, which then generates the glowing lights. The research marks a significant breakthrough in understanding this mysterious phenomenon, and could lead to new insights into other similar phenomena around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
