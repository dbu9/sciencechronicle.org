      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine have conducted a groundbreaking study on ASMR sleep hypnosis, revealing the real hypnotic effect it has on the brain&amp;rsquo;s electric activity. ASMR, which stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, has gained popularity in recent years for its ability to induce a tingling sensation in the scalp and spine, often resulting in relaxation and improved sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the study, participants who regularly experienced ASMR were monitored using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure their brainwave activity during sleep hypnosis sessions. The results showed a significant increase in theta wave activity, which is associated with deep relaxation and the early stages of sleep. This indicates that ASMR sleep hypnosis has a genuine hypnotic effect on the brain, providing scientific evidence to support its sleep-inducing properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
