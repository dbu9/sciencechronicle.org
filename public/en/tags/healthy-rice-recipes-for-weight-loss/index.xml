      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 01, 2024, researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cirm.ca.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; announced a new method for preparing rice that could be useful for weight loss. The team of scientists has discovered a way to modify the starch composition of rice, making it more resistant to digestion and hence beneficial for weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The traditional method of cooking rice involves boiling it in water until it is fully cooked, resulting in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000941.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;high glycemic index (GI)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; food that can cause spikes in blood sugar levels. High GI foods are often linked to weight gain and obesity, as well as an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
