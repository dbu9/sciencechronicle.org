      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Taiwan University have successfully 3D printed and implanted a complex network of liver blood vessels to heal a patient&amp;rsquo;s liver. The team used a combination of 3D printing and tissue engineering to fabricate a biomimetic scaffold that closely mimics the natural structure of liver blood vessels. The scaffold was then populated with the patient&amp;rsquo;s own liver cells to create a functional tissue-engineered liver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The liver is a highly vascular organ, with a complex network of blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to liver cells. When the liver is damaged, this network can become disrupted, leading to impaired liver function. The team&amp;rsquo;s goal was to create a biomimetic scaffold that could be implanted into the liver to restore the disrupted blood vessels and promote healing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
