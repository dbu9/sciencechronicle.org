      <description>&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists at the University of Athens have recently uncovered new evidence in Sparta that suggests anal intercourse was more frequent than vaginal intercourse in Ancient Greece. The findings have caused a stir in the archaeological community, challenging previous beliefs about sexual behavior in Sparta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research was carried out at the ancient site of Sparta, where excavations have been ongoing for several years. The team of archaeologists found a number of artifacts that suggest that Spartan society was much more sexually open than previously thought.  Among the artifacts found were a number of phallic-shaped objects, which experts believe were used for anal intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
