      <description>In a groundbreaking study that sheds new light on the metabolic and inflammatory challenges faced by patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), researchers have explored the intricate relationship between adiponectin levels, systemic inflammation, and weight loss. This research, published in a reputable scientific journal, offers valuable insights into how the body&amp;rsquo;s response to cancer can impact overall health and disease progression.
The Crucial Role of Adiponectin in Cancer-Induced Weight Loss Adiponectin , a hormone produced by adipose tissue, is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and its role in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid breakdown.</description>
