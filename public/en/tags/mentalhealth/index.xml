      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research conducted at the New York Medical Center has found that the popular herb Ashwaganda may induce a more severe 11th stage of depression in some individuals. The study, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez and her team, has raised concerns about the use of Ashwaganda as a natural remedy for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, involved 500 participants who were diagnosed with varying levels of depression. The participants were divided into two groups, with one group receiving Ashwaganda supplements and the other receiving a placebo. Over the course of six months, the researchers monitored the participants&amp;rsquo; symptoms and found that those who had taken Ashwaganda were more likely to experience the 11th stage of depression, which is characterized by a deep sense of hopelessness and despair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
