      <description>Boston University&amp;rsquo;s latest research on human cerebral neuron cell clusters has revealed some fascinating discoveries. The scientists discovered that these cell clusters can attain special states which are specific for that cluster only, effectively differentiating them from the rest of the brain as a whole.
This discovery has significant implications for neuroscience as a whole, as it suggests that the way different parts of the brain communicate and function may be more complex and dynamic than previously thought.</description>
