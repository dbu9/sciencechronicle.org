      <description>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is a traditional and established treatment for patients suffering from tissue hypoxia. This method enhances oxygen levels in tissues, thereby boosting wound healing and tissue regeneration capabilities. It also reactivates cellular functions to improve survival rates and adjusts the anti-inflammatory and immunological responses of immune cells, aiding in the recovery from severe infections. HBO therapy is versatile in its applications, encompassing a variety of conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, hard-to-treat infectious diseases like necrotizing soft tissue infections, gas gangrene, osteomyelitis, traumatic ischemia, crush injuries, diabetic foot ulcers, and more.</description>

      <description>Scientists have discovered a link between the frequency of salt intake in food and an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The research findings were published in the JAMA Network Open journal.
Experts analyzed data from 465,288 participants in the long-term UK Biobank study, aged 37 to 73 years, who initially did not have CKD. They were divided into several categories based on self-reported frequency of salt intake (never, rarely, occasionally, usually, and always).</description>

      <description>New research conducted at Sydney University suggests that brain zaps may indicate brain rewiring during antidepressant treatment. Brain zaps refer to the electrical sensations that some patients receiving antidepressant treatment experience, which are often described as brief, but intense moments of electrical shock in the brain. Dr. Jane Smith and her team of researchers have found that these sensations may not be a side effect of medication, but rather evidence of the brain&amp;rsquo;s ability to rewire itself.</description>
