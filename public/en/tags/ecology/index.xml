      <description>Scientists from Helsinki University have discovered that the behaviour of wood mycorrhizas, the symbiotic relationships between fungi and plants, may be influenced by changes in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s geomagnetic field.
The research, led by Dr. Maria KÃµljalg, studied the growth rates and activity of different species of wood mycorrhizas in a controlled laboratory environment. By exposing the fungi to different levels and orientations of simulated magnetic fields, the researchers found that there was a correlation between the strength and direction of the field and the behaviour of the mycorrhizas.</description>

      <description>Spider species that can survive without food for up to two years have been discovered by a team of researchers at the University of Bukharest. The new species, which has not yet been named, was found in the forests of Romania and exhibits a highly unusual behavior. The spider is able to survive periods of extreme food scarcity, such as droughts or cold winters, by entering a state of torpor, where it slows down its metabolism and becomes almost inactive.</description>

      <title>Sabretooth Extinction Due to Climate Change- Scientific Report from Michigan University</title>

      <description>Sabretooth is a well-known prehistoric predator that went extinct around 10,000 years ago during the last ice age. There are various theories about what caused their extinction, but the most accepted one is that climate change led to the shrinking of their prey, which caused them to struggle to find enough food to survive. This research is focused on the correlation between the disappearance of Sabretooth and the changes in climate which caused their prey to diminish in size.</description>
