      <description>A recent study conducted by researchers at Adelaide University has revealed that elephants possess a specialized structure in their brain that enables them to detect seismic activity. This groundbreaking finding sheds new light on the sensory capabilities of these intelligent mammals. The research team, led by Dr. Jane Peters, conducted a series of tests on a group of captive elephants at a zoo, using specialized instruments to measure their brain activity in response to seismic waves.</description>
