      <description>Researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine have recently conducted a study to determine the optimal amount of chia seeds to consume daily for weight loss. Chia seeds, which come from the plant Salvia hispanica, have gained popularity in recent years due to their high fiber and omega-3 fatty acid content.
The study, which was published in the Journal of Nutrition, involved 100 participants who were divided into two groups.</description>

      <description>Researchers at The Johns Hopkins Hospital have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of hyperbaric oxygen therapy . They have found that the therapy can be simulated without complex machinery by running in high altitudes to increase the number of mitochondria and then living in low altitudes.
The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology , found that running in high altitudes can increase the number of mitochondria in the body.</description>

      <description>Scientists have discovered a link between the frequency of salt intake in food and an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The research findings were published in the JAMA Network Open journal.
Experts analyzed data from 465,288 participants in the long-term UK Biobank study, aged 37 to 73 years, who initially did not have CKD. They were divided into several categories based on self-reported frequency of salt intake (never, rarely, occasionally, usually, and always).</description>

      <description>Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have found that reducing the calorie intake to the level of calorie restriction significantly reduces the risk of cancer and metabolic syndrome. The study, which was conducted on mice, showed that mice on a calorie-restricted diet had less inflammation and oxidative stress within their bodies, which are known to be markers of disease. The findings were published today in the journal Nature Communications.</description>

      <description>Bees are known for their complex social interactions that includes social engineering techniques. A new study conducted at Seoul University has shed light on some of the ways in which bees use social engineering to maintain their hives and ensure the survival of their colonies. The findings of the study were published in the Journal of Insect Behaviour on 12th May 2023.
The study was conducted by a team of researchers led by Dr.</description>

      <description>A recent study conducted at Ottawa University reveals a promising new anti-aging drug that modifies the TOR pathway of immunosystem stem cells, leading to a significant increase in the lifespan of mice and rabbits. The study shows that stem cells&amp;rsquo; unique ability to regenerate different types of cells in the body plays a critical role in aging. While stem cells can divide indefinitely, they also have a limited lifespan, leading to a decline in cellular function and ultimately, death.</description>
