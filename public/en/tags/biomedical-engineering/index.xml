      <description>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has launched a new study to investigate the impact of artificial gravity on long-duration space travel and human health. The research aims to explore whether artificial gravity can help mitigate the negative effects of prolonged weightlessness on the human body. The study, which is expected to take several years, will involve a range of experiments using both animal and human models. The findings could have significant implications for the future of space travel and the health of astronauts.</description>

      <description>Solid tumors have always been a challenge in the field of medical science due to their complex nature and resistance to conventional treatments. However, a recent development by the Lugano University research team promises a breakthrough in the treatment of solid tumors.
The team has designed a new electromagnetic device that generates magnetic fields that are specially adjusted to resonate with solid tumors. The device causes selective heating of the tumor cells, which leads to their destruction while leaving surrounding healthy tissues unaffected.</description>
