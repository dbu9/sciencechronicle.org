      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-money-list-instead-of-a-to-do-list&#34;&gt;A money list instead of a to-do list&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My job revolves around the internet. I earn my living by working on my laptop from the comfort of my chair. However, I face a significant issue: I get easily distracted by trivial matters such as forums, news, blogs, and instant messaging. I wish to stay informed, yet I struggle to accomplish much.&#xA;Creating to-do lists doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to help much; their effectiveness wears off in just three days at most. I can spend weeks dragging out a single task. How can I start to focus my attention without getting sidetracked by the little things? [Richard]&lt;/p&gt;</description>
