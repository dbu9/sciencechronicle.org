      <description>A groundbreaking study conducted by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has successfully treated mild psoriasis using the placebo effect. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide, causing itchy, scaly patches on the skin. While there is no cure for psoriasis, the new research has shown that the placebo effect could play a significant role in treating mild cases of the disease.
The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 100 participants who were given a placebo pill instead of actual medication.</description>

However, the use of these medications can have adverse effects, such as skin atrophy and telangiectasia. A recent study conducted in South California, USA, aimed to explore whether hydroxylated mometasone furoate could effectively treat psoriasis while diminishing these adverse effects.</description>
