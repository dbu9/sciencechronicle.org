      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 12 May 2023, Cape Town Observatory scientists released a report regarding the possibility of a rocky planet in a remote double star system having water oceans on its surface. This discovery has generated a lot of interest in the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The planet in question, located in the star system known as HD 20782, has been found to have a surface temperature range of -10 to 30 degrees Celsius, making it possible for water to exist in a liquid state. The planet has an estimated mass and radius of 1.4 Earths, with a year that lasts approximately 386 Earth days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
