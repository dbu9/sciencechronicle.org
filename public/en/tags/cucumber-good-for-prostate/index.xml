      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consuming 100g of cucumbers a day could help reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer by 28%, according to a study by Manchester University. The research, which looked at the diets of over 20,000 men, found that those who ate a daily portion of cucumbers were significantly less likely to develop the disease than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cucumbers are already known to be a healthy option for those looking to maintain a healthy weight, thanks to their low calorie and high water content. They are also a good source of vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin K and potassium. However, this new research suggests that cucumbers could have even more health benefits than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
