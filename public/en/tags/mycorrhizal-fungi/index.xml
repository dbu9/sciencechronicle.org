      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent research conducted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ottawa.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ottawa University&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; on the phenomenon of wood wide web has revealed some interesting findings. The wood wide web refers to the complex network of underground fungal threads that connect the roots of trees and plants. These fungi form a symbiotic relationship with the plants by exchanging nutrients and other vital compounds. This network is crucial for the survival and health of the plants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research focused on the effects of several species of ants and termites on the mycorrhizal network. The mycorrhizal network is the part of the wood wide web that connects the roots of plants with the underground fungal threads. The researchers observed that when some species of ants and termites disturbed the network by digging tunnels, the mycorrhizal links were restored within a matter of days. This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the wood wide web and its resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
