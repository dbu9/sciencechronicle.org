      <description>&lt;p&gt;Princeton University scientists have recently made a breakthrough by developing innovative nanoswimmers that can travel a long distance inside the human blood stream to find and attack a cancer target in the brain. This innovative approach is expected to bring about a significant reduction in the number of cancer cell deaths that originate from brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These nanoswimmers are composed of tiny, self-propelling robots that are only a few microns in size. They are designed to move through the human body and locate cancer cells in the brain. The biomedical applications of these nanobots are remarkable, as they represent a new way of thinking about cancer treatment. They travel through the bloodstream and can make their way to even the most remote areas of the body to search for cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
