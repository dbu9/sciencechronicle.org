      <description>New research from the University of Belgrad has identified a key mechanism by which endothelial cells are able to thrive and reproduce, offering hope for improved treatments for a wide range of conditions ranging from cancer to heart disease. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, focuses on the role of Nox1/Ref-1-mediated activation of the transcription factor CREB in promoting endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which is essential for the formation of new blood vessels and the repair of damaged tissues.</description>
