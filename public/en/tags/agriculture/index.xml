      <description>On June 10, 2023, researchers from Cornell University started a project to investigate the use of gene editing technologies for enhancing crop resilience and food security. The project aims to develop gene editing tools that could help to introduce new traits such as drought resistance, disease resistance, and increased yields into crops. This technology has the potential to help farmers produce crops that are more resilient to changing environmental conditions and to produce more food to feed a growing global population.</description>
