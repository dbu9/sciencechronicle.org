      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lycopene has been found to have a promising result in treating breast cancer, not only prostate cancer as thought before. Researchers at the Walter and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wehi.edu.au/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have recently discovered that lycopene, a naturally occurring chemical found in red fruits and vegetables, has the potential to significantly inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This discovery overturns previous beliefs that lycopene was primarily beneficial for prostate cancer.
