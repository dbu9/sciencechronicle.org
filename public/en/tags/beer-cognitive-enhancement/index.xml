      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study conducted at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Free University of Berlin&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; has shown that beer may have a nootropic effect when dosed proportionally to the average &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;somatotropin&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; hormone level in the blood. Somatotropin is a type of growth hormone that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the human body. It is known to improve cognitive functioning, mood, and overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a group of 50 participants who were administered varying doses of beer based on their somatotropin hormone levels. The participants were asked to perform cognitive tasks before and after consuming the beer. The results showed a significant improvement in cognitive performance in those who consumed beer that was dosed proportionally to their somatotropin levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
