      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bees are known for their complex social interactions that includes social engineering techniques. A new study conducted at Seoul University has shed light on some of the ways in which bees use social engineering to maintain their hives and ensure the survival of their colonies. The findings of the study were published in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/journal/10905&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Journal of Insect Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; on 12th May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by a team of researchers led by Dr. Kim Sun, a professor in the Department of Ecology at Seoul University. The team used a combination of observation, experimentation, and mathematical modeling to gain insights into the social behavior of bees and how they influence each other through social engineering strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
