      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.su.se/cmlink/stockholm-university&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stockholm University&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have found that chia seeds contain compounds structurally similar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racetam&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;racetams&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a class of drugs known for their cognitive-enhancing effects. These compounds, when consumed, are believed to act as nootropic agents, potentially improving memory and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted by a team of Swedish researchers, analyzed the chemical composition of chia seeds and found several compounds with similar structures to racetams. These compounds are believed to have potential cognitive-enhancing effects due to their ability to increase blood flow and oxygen uptake in the brain, leading to improved cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
