      <description>&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA), the most prevalent disorder impacting &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_joint&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;synovial joints&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, stands as a primary source of movement-related disabilities and poses a significant challenge to health services. It was once considered merely a result of wear and tear due to age and injury. However, current understanding portrays OA as a dynamic phenomenon involving damage to joint tissues and the body&amp;rsquo;s efforts to repair these tissues. This condition can arise from abnormal stress on a healthy joint or typical stress on a compromised joint. In many instances, a combination of these factors is at play. Thus, OA emerges from a complex interplay of various processes and risk factors. The significance of these risk factors can vary depending on the joint, and the factors influencing the onset of OA may be different from those affecting its progression. While natural joint repair mechanisms often counterbalance initial damage, leading to OA without symptoms, there are cases where these mechanisms fail, resulting in symptomatic OA accompanied by pain and loss of function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
