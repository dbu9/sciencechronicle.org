      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Boston University have found that consuming 100 grams of cucumbers and 100 grams of tomatoes daily could help reduce the risk of small intestine cancerous polyps by up to 43%. The study, which was published in the Journal of Oncology, involved analyzing the dietary habits of over 2,500 participants, all of whom had previously undergone a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that participants who regularly consumed cucumber and tomato experienced a lesser incidence of small intestine polyps compared to those who did not eat these healthy vegetables. Moreover, the research indicated that a higher intake of these two vegetables correlated with a greater reduction in the odds of developing cancerous polyps in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
