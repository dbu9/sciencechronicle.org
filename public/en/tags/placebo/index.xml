      <description>Michigan University conducted a research that revealed reiki techniques work as a powerful placebo treatment, which can overcome standard drugs in their efficiency.
Reiki is a Japanese spiritual practice that uses the hands to promote healing and reduce stress. The technique involves the channeling of energy that can be felt by the recipient as a warm or tingling sensation. While some might dismiss reiki as pseudoscience, scientists at Michigan University found that it&amp;rsquo;s a powerful placebo, that can be used to treat pain, anxiety, and depression.</description>
