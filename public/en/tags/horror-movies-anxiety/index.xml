      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by Toronto University scholars has shown that horror movies can reduce anxiety levels in individuals experiencing social and generalized anxiety disorders. The research team revealed that the films helped these individuals to feel more relaxed and less anxious, a surprising finding that contradicts popular belief.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The team screened several horror movies to participants with social anxiety, including paranormal, slasher, and suspense films. They then evaluated the participants&amp;rsquo; response levels before, during and after viewing, using an anxiety rating scale. The results showed that participants experienced a noticeable decrease in their anxiety levels after watching the movies. The study found a significant correlation between reduced anxiety levels and exposure to horror movies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
