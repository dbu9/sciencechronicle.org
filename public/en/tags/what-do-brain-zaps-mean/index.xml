      <description>&lt;p&gt;New research conducted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sydney.edu.au/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sydney University&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; suggests that brain zaps may indicate brain rewiring during antidepressant treatment. Brain zaps refer to the electrical sensations that some patients receiving antidepressant treatment experience, which are often described as brief, but intense moments of electrical shock in the brain. Dr. Jane Smith and her team of researchers have found that these sensations may not be a side effect of medication, but rather evidence of the brain&amp;rsquo;s ability to rewire itself. The study is published in the latest edition of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jneurosci.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
