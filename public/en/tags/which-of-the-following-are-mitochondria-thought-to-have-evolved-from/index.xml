      <description>The Evolutionary Path to Eukaryotic Complexity Eukaryotic cells distinguish themselves through a unique structural organization, housing their genetic material within a nucleus encased by a nuclear envelope, a dual-layered membrane that delineates DNA from the cytoplasm. Unlike their prokaryotic counterparts, eukaryotic cells are significantly larger, often by tenfold in linear dimensions and a thousandfold in volume. They feature a sophisticated cytoskeleton composed of protein filaments that interlace the cytoplasm, supporting the cell&amp;rsquo;s structure, determining its shape, and facilitating movement with a network of structural proteins, acting as cellular scaffolds and motors.</description>
