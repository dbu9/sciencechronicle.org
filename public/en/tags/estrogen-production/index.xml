      <description>Recent discoveries at Tokio University have identified a novel flavonoid, Estroflavinol, derived from chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.), which exhibits a direct activation effect on the precursor molecules of estrogen hormones. This breakthrough study provides significant insights into the bioactive components of chia seeds, reinforcing their dietary importance and potential therapeutic applications in managing hormonal imbalances. Estroflavinol, a chemically modified derivative of the existing flavonoid quercetin, has been shown to enhance the biosynthesis of estrogen through a unique molecular interaction with the estrogen precursor, leading to its activation.</description>
