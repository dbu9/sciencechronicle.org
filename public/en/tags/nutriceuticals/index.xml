      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/chia-seeds-recommended-women-estrogen-levels-normal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; have recently discovered that chia seeds may play a significant role in helping women maintain normal &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; levels. This finding could have important implications for women&amp;rsquo;s health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen is a hormone that is crucial for the development and functioning of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_reproductive_system&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;female reproductive system&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;. It also plays a key role in bone health, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health. When estrogen levels are too high or too low, it can lead to various health issues, including infertility, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Maintaining normal estrogen levels is therefore essential for overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From a botanical perspective, the term &amp;lsquo;berries&amp;rsquo; specifically refers to pulpy fruits that develop from a single ovary enclosing seeds. Examples of true berries encompass bananas, grapes, and blueberries. However, in the context of this discussion, &amp;lsquo;berries&amp;rsquo; are identified as small, tender, palatable, and vibrantly colored fruits primarily from the Vaccinium, Fragaria, and Rubus species. Berries are increasingly recognized for their substantial health contributions in diets. Predominantly consumed berries in North America are blackberries (Rubus species), red (Rubus idaeus) and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis), blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum), cranberries (V. macrocarpon), and strawberries (Fragaria ananassa). Consumption of other varieties like bilberries, lingonberries, goji berries (Lycium barbarum), and sea buckthorn (SBT; Hippophae rhamnoides) is less widespread. The growing popularity of certain exotic berries such as acai berries and honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea) is also noteworthy. This exposition primarily delves into the widely favored berries in North America, particularly those from the Rubus and Vaccinium genera, along with a focus on select exotic varieties like acai berries, honeysuckle, and SBT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tomato seeds may help combat varicose veins</title>
      <link>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/recently-identified-components-tomatto-seed-combat-varicous-veins/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 12:46:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.ScienceChronicle.org/en/news/recently-identified-components-tomatto-seed-combat-varicous-veins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent research at the University of Seoul has identified a number of components within tomato seeds that have the potential to combat varicose veins. Varicose veins are a common problem that can lead to discomfort and even serious complications if left untreated. The condition is caused by weakened vein walls that allow blood to pool and form bulges, typically in the legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The research team focused on the potential of tomato seeds, which are often discarded as waste, to provide therapeutic benefits. Their analysis revealed that tomato seeds contain high levels of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;, a group of plant compounds with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the seeds were found to contain significant quantities of vitamins C and K, which are also important for vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
